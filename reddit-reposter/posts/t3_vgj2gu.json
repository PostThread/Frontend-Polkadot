After I told my boss we are in the middle of building a house that should be done in Oct/Nov he changed my hours. Now I work 12-14 hours a day, including every other weekend. I feel he is taking advantage of me knowing I can\u2019t quit or we will lose the financing for the house.\n\nThis came out because I needed to leave early one day and he asked why, so I just blurted out to go over our blueprint with the builder.\n\nDo not share any information where they can take advantage of you, I made the mistake and feel stuck now. \n\nCurrently working 5:00am to 6:00 pm most days. Sometimes I stay later depending on the work load.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/vgj2gu/made_the_mistake_of_telling_my_boss_we_are/", "is_nsfw": false}
