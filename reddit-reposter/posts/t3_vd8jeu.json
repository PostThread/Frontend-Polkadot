Two TRILLION dollars), so that means those market participants will get over $84,000,000 (84 million dollars) total when they return those securities tomorrow on 6/16/22. There were 96 market participants, meaning of that $84,000,000 on average the market participants will get back  approximately $875,000 tomorrow EACH. This happens on a DAILY BASIS! On average over $4,000,000 a week is going to these market participants. \n\nSo while market participants are getting nearly a million dollars daily on average, the average citizen is paying over 8% more this year for gas, food, rent, and more. \n\nOh yeah. That 8% more? Yeah\u2026 It\u2019s most likey double digits (think 10% to 15% minimum) thanks to the Federal Reserves recalculation of what\u2019s included in their inflation \u201ccalculations\u201d\n\nWhen the shit TRULY hits the economic fan, don\u2019t be angry at your neighbor for whatever their personal choices are. Be mad at those who are responsible.\n\nAs someone I know once said \u201cTo hell with the left and the right. Stop dividing the people\ud83d\udc9c\u201d\n\nBullish\n\nEdit 1: Maf\n\nEdit 2: The point I\u2019m trying to make is that market participants are getting paid more daily by the federal reserve while everyday people continue to be hurt by inflation\n\nI am not trying to say the RRP award is tied to inflation in any way", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/vd8jeu/the_reverse_repo_award_rate_going_up_nearly_100/", "is_nsfw": false}
