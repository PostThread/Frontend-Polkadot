I\u2019m just a concerned citizen hoping to save someone some trouble when grandpa\u2019s unique house key (that nobody ever bothered to make a copy of) gets eaten by the Postal system.\n\nYou know those plain white envelopes that everyone has a few of hanging around? Please don\u2019t put a key in one and expect it to reach its destination. Ever.\n\nEverything letter-shaped nowadays is processed by machines at approximately 30,000 pieces per hour. That\u2019s slightly less than ten pieces per second. Those machines have belts that are strong enough to withstand one heck of a jam-up. They will accelerate your key straight out when the envelope stops in a sortation bin, no questions asked. Oh, and they make quite a mess while at it.\n\nWriting \u201cprocess by hand\u201d doesn\u2019t help, unfortunately. We legit don\u2019t have the staffing to fish your individual letter out of the pile. In fact, the vast majority of letters are never touched by human hands or seen at all until they are delivered.\n\nI hope this helps, and please give your grandpa a hug for me.\n\n\nEDIT:  Yowza! Thank you for the awards, kind Internet strangers! I hope you are having a lovely day :)\n\nEDIT EDIT: I'm whooped and gonna head off to bed. I'll try to answer any remaining questions tomorrow. Thanks for all the questions and entertainment! Somewhere along the way we ended up on r/all which was kinda cool (and that, with a couple of dollars, will buy you a cup of coffee).  I think we peaked at #21? This was my very first viral anything (except maybe COVID) and I hope I did right by everyone.
