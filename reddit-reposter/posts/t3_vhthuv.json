High me was doing some shopping on the zon and was like, damn I wish I had some mac and cheese.  After a weird succession of searching I found the motherload.  A bucket of the cheese powder.  I thought you had to buy THE box mix forever.  It\u2019s so much cheaper and you can make as little or as disgustingly much as you want.  Good tip for parents but also grown up trash humans who wanna crush a bunch of deliciousness.   The kind I got is called \u201cbig daddy\u201d but I\u2019m sure they\u2019re all in the same boat of neon orange goodness.\n\n\nEdit: Ok so I figured everyone would find their own since there are a million, but this is what I bought and have been loving:  \n\nHoosier Hill Farm Big Daddy Mac Mix, 1 Pound \nhttps://a.co/d/7kdinuM\n(A bunch of folks recommended nuts.com so we don\u2019t give bezos another trip to space)\n\nI followed the \u201crecipe\u201d on the jar and my first batch had wayyyy too much flavor - thought I\u2019d made a big mistake.  Cut it in like half and tweaked it from there and am loving it now.   And it\u2019s gonna last me way longer now too.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/vhthuv/lpt_if_you_love_box_mac_and_cheese_you_can_buy_a/", "is_nsfw": false}
