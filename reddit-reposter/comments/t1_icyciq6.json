Please reply to this comment with an [explanation](https://www.reddit.com/r/LeopardsAteMyFace/comments/lt8zlq) mentioning **who** is suffering from **which** consequences from **what** they voted for, supported or wanted to impose on other people.\n\nHere's an easy format to get you started:\n\n1. *Someone* voted for, supported or wanted to impose *something* on other people.  \n  ^(Who's that *someone* and what's that *something*?)\n2. That *something* has some *consequences*.  \n  ^(What are the *consequences*?)\n3. As a consequence, that *something* happened to that *someone*.  \n  ^(What happened? Did the *something* really happened to that *someone*? If not, you should probably delete your post.)\n\nInclude the minimum amount of information necessary so your post can be understood by everyone, even if they don't live in the US or speak English as their native language. If you don't respect this format and moderators can't match your explanation with the format, your post will be removed under rule #3 and we'll ignore you even if you complain in modmail.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
