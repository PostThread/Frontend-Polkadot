I only pray petro can try to do what he can for the good of the people. My family supported fajardo in the first round and decided to not vote in the second round, many of my younger cousins voted for petro, for obvious reasons, while some of my older aunts and uncles voted for rodolfo. Whatever happens in the coming years, something is clear, colombia is very divided, always has been. Although i will reserve my thought on petro and wait and see what he can deliver, i think the people gave a message. We are tired of the same cycle, people are exhausted, angry, and frustrated. People are willing to take a risk now. Let\u2019s see where that takes us."}
