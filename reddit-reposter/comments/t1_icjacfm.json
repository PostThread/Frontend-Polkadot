I got sick on vacation once, worse pain I've ever felt. Literally felt like my insides were going to try to burst out of my abdomen, and then honestly sounded like a pleasant mercy at that point. I was starting to actually feel like I was going to die. This is a perfect description for how I felt. It was like instinctually I just wanted to find a nice dark, deep, cold hole and just curl up at the bottom. \n\nMy younger sister gets them very bad like that now, really puts it into perspective. I can't imagine having to deal with that and knowing it's coming."}
