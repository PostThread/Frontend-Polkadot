This was from last season of American Ninja Warrior. I made it past the next obstacle, but fell on the one after as my upper body was toast. Just missed out moving on in the competition, as my time was too slow to move on (I wonder why???)\n\nI\u2019ll be on the next episode of American Ninja Warrior on 06/20. Maybe I\u2019ll get to face off against the logs again!"}
