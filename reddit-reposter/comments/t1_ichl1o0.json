It's about your ability to think with clarity regardless of your age. If you're on the left you don't have to compare Biden to Trump, compare Biden to Bernie Sanders. Sanders is old too, but he doesn't show his age when he is speaking in front of a crowd or talking to the press. He thinks with the clarity of a 30 year old, not a guy in a nursing home suffering from dementia."}
