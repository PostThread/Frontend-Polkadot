I was coming home one night and saw a person crossing the street that I was about to turn on. I slowed down so he could have time to cross before I turned. As I was turning the person behind me honked which scared the guy to death because he thought I was honking at him and didn\u2019t realize I was there. I felt so bad because he didn\u2019t have an umbrella. So I drove back around to try to give him mine, but when he saw my car he picked up his pace as if he thought I was coming for him. Then when I opened my window he ducked into some bushes. I felt so bad I just made his night even worse\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f"}
