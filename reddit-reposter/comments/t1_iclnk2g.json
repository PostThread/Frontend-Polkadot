We finally bought a house. Last night I made my boyfriend go to Lowe\u2019s with me to look for flowers, and I was looking at all the different garden fencing options and talking about how cute they all were, and how I could make this and that out of these, and he goes \u201cyou just transferred your Animal Crossing obsession to real life, didn\u2019t you?\u201d And he\u2019s 100% right. I\u2019ve been getting down on hands and knees to dig in the dirt every day off I\u2019ve had since April. Boyfriend thinks it\u2019s really cool and can\u2019t wait to see what I did when it blooms next spring. I\u2019ve already had some lilies bloom this year that I planted only two months ago. He asked \u201chow much does all this cost?\u201d And I said it costs time and labor, not really much money. Seeds are a few bucks. Tools are a few bucks. All you need is about $80 and determination!"}
