Agree on posting it for like a week straight \nEvery single post refers to a \u201cLink in the bio\u201d, those are not even meme pages \nAnd that's for the memes, once, I followed a medical page, which was created to post medical facts/info \nThey randomly started posting the same images and posts all over and over again \nThat's why I can't stand Instagram (Also, It's FULL of little kids, much, much much more of any other social media, especially Instagram Italy)"}
