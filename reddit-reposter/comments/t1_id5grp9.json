We got all kinds of bangers like Hercules, Mulan, Pocahontas, The Prince of Egypt, etc. In my opinion, it was the last great push of animated blockbusters before Toy Story and the insanely popular (and great) Pixar Leviathan we know today existed. Aladdin, The Little Mermaid and others were great however I seem to remember Hercules being on the latter end of the genre. The Land Before Time is probably still my favorite and I don't care if I'm a grown a** man, I'll still bawl my eyes out when LittleFoots mom dies..ugh my gawd. \ud83d\ude2a\ud83e\udd27"}
