Was anti social with me,  his file at the vet was flagged \"unfriendly\"...and then I got pregnant. He slept on my tummy every night,  never left my side,  and watched over my son with the tolerance of a saint no matter what he did.   We lost him about 3 years ago,  not a day goes by i don't miss my furry co parent."}
