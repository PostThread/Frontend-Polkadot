Me, sis and our mom were all at the house helping her pack. She told the sherriff to please keep him away, he is violent and has guns/bows in the house (a hunter), and the sherriff agreed to keep him away from the house until we left.\n\nSis went to drop some stuff off at the storage unit after maybe an hour or so. Well, guess who came walking up through the woods around the house? Sherriff dropped him a ways up the road and he walked home. Me and mom were terrified, her more than me just because I didn't fully understand what could happen. He said some mean and angry things to us, and went into the bedroom (where the guns were). When sis got back we all left as fast as possible. We were lucky, this story could have ended much differently.\n\nSis was SO angry. I don't blame her. He was over 6 feet tall and could have easily overpowered us or worse. You can't depend on the cops for anything.\n\nFuck you, \"Sherriff\" Stevie Thomas, you worthless piece of shit."}
