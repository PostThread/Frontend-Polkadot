The hotel owner, who hired those unqualified people to cut costs, died in the collapse. There were also signs at least a day before the collapse that the building's pillars were under heavy strain and would soon give in, and the owner was made aware of this, but didn't bother trying to evacuate people. In the end, 33 people died for this."}
