I always assumed I'd be able to afford them, even if it meant budgeting and cutting a few hobbies here and there.\n\n\nI cannot even afford to support myself. Like many millennials, I'm stuck at home. I can't afford to buy a house and if I start renting, I never will. There is no way to really save.\n\n\nI did everything I was \"supposed to\". I went to college, but the jobs in my field didn't pay enough to survive on and your work load is more than what's safe for an individual to handle. I'd make more money in other fields.\n\nI have a bachelor's in psychology  because I wanted to be a therapist and help people, specifically those who are seriously struggling with suicide and self harm. My job, the work, it's needed. Society is filled with people who need help _but I can't afford to be the one to help them_.\n\n\nI hate this country"}
