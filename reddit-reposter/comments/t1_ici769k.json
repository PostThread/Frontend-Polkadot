They were put under a consent decree (federal oversight) by Obama's DOJ. When Trump was trying to undo everything Obama did his DOJ took a look at APD and decided to keep the consent decree in place. It remains to this day.\n\nRio Rancho PD- the ones arresting him- have an excellent reputation for professionalism and community service. And they are not fond of APD.\n\nAs you can see in the video."}
