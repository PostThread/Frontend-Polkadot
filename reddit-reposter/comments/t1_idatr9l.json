It's a terrible condition that sometimes feels like you can't win.\n\nAs a manager, I reach out usually within a half hour- especially if they are rarely late.  I could care less about the job, but want to make sure they aren't on the side of the road or an emergency happened.  I know it's frowned upon to say \"family like\" when describing where you work but it is the way I feel about many of them."}
