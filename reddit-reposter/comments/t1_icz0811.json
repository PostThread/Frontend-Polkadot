I\u2019ve always wanted to go with an expedition group and be trained to be around gorillas. I watched the documentary about Jane Goodall and was just overcome with awe and admiration. To be amongst these beautiful, intelligent creatures and see how they live would be a dream come true. I know there is a danger in it but if your aware of how to properly react, are respectful and trained from what I understand most the time there isn\u2019t a problem."}
