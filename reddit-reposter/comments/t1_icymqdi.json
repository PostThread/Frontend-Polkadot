Had a first date with a girl that went well. Then on Friday setup a brunch date for Sunday. Texted Sunday morning at 8am and she got back to me at noon saying she slept in and thought I ghosted her.\n\nI did reschedule on Sunday for Tuesday. Then texted on Monday night at 7pm to confirm Tuesday. Said she thought I ghosted again and had to cancel. At that point I moved on."}
