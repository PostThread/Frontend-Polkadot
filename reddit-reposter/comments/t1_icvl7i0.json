One of my \u201cboobie buddies\u201d did the whole hair shave party. Her husband shaved his, in solitary. \n\nAnd there was a big cancerous growth under his dark and thick hair. \n\nThey did chemo together, had surgery together, and healed together. That hair shave saved his life.\n\nEdit. There\u2019s a typo. Solidarity instead of solitary. He\u2019s not in prison."}
