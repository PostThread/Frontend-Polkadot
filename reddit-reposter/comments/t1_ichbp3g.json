The Terrace House commentators **lead the charge** on bullying the young woman.\n\nShe was only 22 on a reality dating show, and they tore her apart over minor social behavior that is looked down on in Japan (being more americanized, athletic looking, forward). The commentators were **brutal** and they personally signaled the green light to the fanbase to ridicule and harass the young girl.\n\nBullying in Japan continues to be an acceptable social norm."}
