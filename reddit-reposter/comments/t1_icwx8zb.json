That record contract held him for twenty years.  He was an old friend of mine too, and I remember him telling me that the Wham! The Final album made him and Andrew Ridgely about 500k each.  That was it.  The album was jammed full of hits, Careless Whisper, Everything She Wants, Wake me Up Before you Go Go, Last Christmas, Different Corner, and on and on.  That album was top of the charts globally.\n\nGeorge told me that he and Andrew were 18 years old -  in the studio, high on life, doing what they were born to do and a record company exec turned up and said, \"sorry boys, if you don't sign this contract you'll have to go home.\"  So they signed it and carried on recording.  No lawyer.\n\nImagine being that dickhead that did that to two young talented kids, he didn't get the money, it went to a corporation.  Artist need as much protection as they can get."}
