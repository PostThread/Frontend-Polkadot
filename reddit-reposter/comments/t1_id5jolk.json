There are thousands of videos on YT of police corruption. Thousands of videos of police violating our rights because they don't even know the fucking law. Police have literally become state revenue generators. Speeding tickets, parking tickets, brake light tickets, these are all reason people hate police. They financially terrorize us, and abuse their power. On top of all that, they are only foot soilders of the government as this post suggests."}
