That little boy is going to be years ahead of his classmates academically because of how his dad engages him, not just because his dad is going to end up building his vocabulary faster than other kids (vocabulary gets built not just by reading, but by engaging in intellectual conversations on a regular basis), but also by the confidence he is instilling in the kid by lovingly valuing his input from the very beginning. This is so awesome."}
