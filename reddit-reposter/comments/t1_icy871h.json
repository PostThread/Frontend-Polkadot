Constructive Criticism is encouraged, but do remember the human.\r\n\r\nDON'T BE INAPPROPRIATE We'd like our users to feel comfortable sharing their images/projects without getting hit on or judged. They\u2019re here to talk about their sewing related things, not about their general looks or attractiveness. Complimenting OP on their project is fine, but commenting on other aspects of their appearance, or making sexualized comments, no matter how well-intentioned, is considered inappropriate in this subreddit.\r\n\r\nAlso - if you see a comment that is inappropriate PLEASE REPORT the comment, don't just down-vote it!\r\n\r\nThanks - Sewing Subreddit Mod Team!"}
