The law that legalized hemp allows for cannabis products that contain less than 0.3% THC to be sold as an agricultural product and not a drug. Edibles, liquids, even flower with low THC and high CBD.\n\nThat still means you can get an edible that will destroy you, legally. You can legitimately go to a supermarket and get a tincture that will blast you into orbit if you take too big of a dose. This happened to me a year ago. I was used to taking CBD tinctures that contained 0% THC and decided to try the full spectrum kind that was sold at my pharmacy. I took a few droppers full under my tongue and 2 hours later I was higher than I had ever been in my entire life. I thought I was having a stroke. Then I looked at the test results on the package, did the math, and realized I potentially took about 40mg of THC."}
