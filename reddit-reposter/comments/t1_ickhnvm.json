We've strived to always listen to what our community has to say and hearing about your reputation and love for our game we want you to know that we hear you loud and clear. We didn't expect this to go so viral so to celebrate we would like to announce we're releasing Skyrim for the TI-84. Now you'll have more ways to play your favorite games. \n\nSincerely, \nT-Money \n\ud83e\udd73\n\n\nEdit: Wow you guys you've done it again. You've shown massive support for us and we simply can't thank you enough. We understand that times are hard and money can run a little tight. So with our TI-84 release we're offering a discounted rate of only ~~$60~~ $49.99."}
