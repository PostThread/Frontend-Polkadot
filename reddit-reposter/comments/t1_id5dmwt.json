No matter what and he wouldnt ask questions if I didnt want him to. I know for a fact I will have that talk with children when that day comes.\n\nIt was so important for him to make sure I knew the only thing that mattered was I make it home safe. and having that safety net in the back of my mind gave me so much comfort. I love you Dad"}
