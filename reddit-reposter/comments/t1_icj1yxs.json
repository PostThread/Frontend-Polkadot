Any time we walked anywhere in the apartment it would shake the floor because the old building was kind of, you know, old.  She would constantly run through her apartment at all hours banging on the walls and ceiling.  The best one was Christmas morning, me and my family are all having fun opening presents, doing the Christmas thing, and she starts fucking screaming and banging on the walls.  After many confrontations with her, it all culminated into one day my wife and I were out to breakfast with the baby, and we forgot to pack diapers, so we head back home to get some to find that someone had superglued my door locks so I couldn\u2019t get in the house.  We called property management and they came and let us in by having the maintenance man go through a window on a ladder.  We didn\u2019t have any proof that she did it, but my neighbor told them that he saw her sister going up the stairs earlier in the day just after we left the house.  A week later she was served with an eviction notice, the reason was that she had broken her lease agreement by refusing to let the maintenance man in her apartment to do the quarterly checks (they checked the pipes and heaters for water or fire risk).  So they couldn\u2019t evict her for glueing my lock, since there was no evidence, but they knew she was a nuisance, and came up with whatever they could to get her out."}
