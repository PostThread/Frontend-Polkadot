Today is the day that I learned that I am truly lazy. \n\nThis is awesome, but I get tired just thinking of how to put all this together.  \n\nThere is so much software that makes this really easy.  These guys made due with a washing machine, an fx pedal, a bucket, and a floor. \n\nGood for these guys for their dedication.  I certainly couldn't put the time in to do this.\n\nPS: if they tour it might void the warranty of the washing machine.  Roadies aren't know for their feather touch ;)"}
