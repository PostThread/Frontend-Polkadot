And they aren't covering the hearings in any meaningful way.  Other than to insult the hearings and those holding them, the hearings aren't even mentioned during prime time on Fox.   We should note that Murdoch became a naturalized US citizen only after it became clear to him that he would not be able to legally own media in the US without that citizenship.  I don't believe he actually believes in America at all."}
