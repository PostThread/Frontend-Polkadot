He keeps saying that I\u2019m okay with men being raped. Like, 1. That wasn\u2019t said. 2. If anyone thinks that then they missed the point of this post. \n\nTo me it seems like he\u2019s sympathetic to men who abuses women, because that\u2019s literally the only reason I can think of to be offended. I obviously would NEVER condone any kind of abuse towards anyone. Period. (But self defense is always okay)"}
