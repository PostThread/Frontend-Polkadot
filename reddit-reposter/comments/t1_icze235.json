AquaTherm to be precise. Its really not better than using Copper, Pex, or pvc. From an installation standpoint you now have a heavy ass iron that you have to maneuver overhead sometimes and then put down to attach a fitting. Also when you push the joint on you have to hold it for about 10-15 seconds  or else it will start to pop off the end of the pipe. When you have a shit load of joints to do it just becomes a waste of time after a while. So i would rather use a torch or glue to connect joints before using this."}
