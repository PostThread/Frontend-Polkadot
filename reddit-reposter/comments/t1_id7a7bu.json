Many people here have suggested it. Show us Luke and Vader ruling the galaxy. Obi Wan, Anakin, Padme if things worked out and they stopped Palpatune\u2019s plan. Darth Jar Jar. Just have fun with it. They don\u2019t have the multiverse to worry about so they can just queue this up and fun what if stories. Windu surviving and working his way up to challenge Vader would be cool. Maybe have him reconnect with Yoda and Kenobi and have it be an all out battle between those three and the other two big baddies. \n\nAs for adding it to the actual canon, not really interested. If Sam Jackson wants to come back you can do a Tales of the Jedi type thing or you have to make it a story where like Vader is hunting him through Coruscant after Order 66 and he dies by the last episode. We can\u2019t have another Jedi Master just hanging out not doing anything. At least Kenobi has babysitting duty and Yoda has losing his mind in a swamp. \n\nMaybe if you\u2019re going to have him back. Have it be part of a Vader series with Hayden where he\u2019s just hunting down the remaining Jedi in a sort of horror monster chasing down the teenagers set up. They\u2019re already sort of touching on that with Kenobi though."}
