It\u2019s always an impala, charger, or an old pontiac.  They drive just like this\u2026flying through residential areas, blowing through stop signs at 50 mph.  The police dept in St Louis has a \u201chands off\u201d approach to policing so nothing ever happens to these degenerates until they actually kill someone.  So glad I moved out of the city.  If somebody pulled this shit around my current neighborhood there would be no need for cops."}
