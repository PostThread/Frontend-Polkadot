Each day between 4000-10000 animals are euthanized in shelters each day, 9 out of 10 being to adoptable animals because of over crowding. Over 50% are unweaned kittens. If you have cats and aren't de-sexing them, you are part of the problem. But you can still do your part, they can still be de-sexed after having a litter."}
