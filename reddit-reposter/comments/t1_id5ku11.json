I hope they have no respite in sleep, that those dead children haunt their dreams. \n\nIf by some small chance the cops didn\u2019t kill a kid or a teacher directly, their inaction was deadly in itself. I want autopsy results on all those killed. Let\u2019s see what bullets came from whom.\n\nMay God have mercy on them. I find I cannot.\n\nETA wow do I get Victorian when I\u2019m pissed off."}
