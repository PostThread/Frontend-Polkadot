Genetically, it is human; and its cells replicate themselves, indicating life.\n\nHowever, this point is an irrelevant distraction from what is truly important: that ***personhood* does *not* begin at conception.** The brain is simply not developed enough in the first two trimesters of pregnancy to have even close to similar value to that of a developed person.\n\nThus, **the rights and choices of the womb-bearer are still much more important than the rights of their developing fetus in the first two trimesters, regardless of the latter's statuses as human and/or alive, as the fetus is still not an established *person*.**"}
