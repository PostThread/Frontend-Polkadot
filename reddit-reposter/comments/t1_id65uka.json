Our minimum paying job this year is 20.92, have to wait to being here for 13 years before you're up to 4 weeks of vacation, but I'm sitting at 3 weeks right now because you get 3 from year 5 to 12. We get 18 sick days a year which is nice and 12 holidays also plus one floating holiday. Health care keeps getting worse though. And every contract negotiation they keep trying to take more and more away instead of trying to make people happy. It...kinda boggles my mind because they keep trying ways to get rid of the union and if they really wanted to they could...you know...treat everybody well for like 10 years and get on their good side and then do a rug pull...but they just keep being bags of dicks every 5 years.\n\nEdit: I forgot we get 4 personal days a year too."}
