There is very little conscious choice involved, it\u2019s very impulsive, compulsive and obsessive. It isn\u2019t logical. There is selfishness involved of course, but he is suffering. Sobriety forces you to deal with DEEP seeded issues and that is hard and scary. As a recovering alcoholic I wish him the best."}
