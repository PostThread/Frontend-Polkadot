In incident response there are rules for who is in charge under what circumstances.  The first thing he would have done on arriving is find out who is in charge of the incident and determine whether he should take charge or not.  He should have known by name exactly who is in charge and if he didn't, that in itself is incompetence worthy of firing."}
