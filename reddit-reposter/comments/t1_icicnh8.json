Heroes have gotten way too over the top where it just becomes dumb. Doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m not a fan of the overall universe though\n\nEdit 2: there may be some confusion here, I should\u2019ve mentioned that INCONSISTENCY is huge. Sometimes you have a character doing something incredible, but then that same character can\u2019t accomplish a feat that should be 100x easier than something he/she has done before"}
