Its clear robots are as alive in the Star Wars universe as any other alien race, yet they are treated worse than slaves by both the good and bad sides. C3PO and R2D2's memory being erased like its nothing, given away like slaves. \n\nIts quite hypocritical from the good side to treat droids like slaves yet be all goody two shoes about helping the flesh bodied creatures of the universe."}
