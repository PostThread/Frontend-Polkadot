This is why I am so closed off at work to bosses, co-workers, etc. Friendly af, courteous af and helpful af, but I didn't even tell my boss we were selling our house until she confronted me about it 2 days before the sale after driving by and seeing the sold sign out front. I did my salaried duties flawlessly and packed/cleaned/moved/sold a 3/2/2500 at the same time, as I fucking SHOULD be able to. I'm sorry your boss is a jealous asshole with a control problem."}
