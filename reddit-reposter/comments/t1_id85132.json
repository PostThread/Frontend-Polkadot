I took that opportunity to tell them that the LAPD will probably not come when you need them to.  \n\nI was also pulled over on an electric bike with my then 7 year old daughter on the back. We were fully compliant with all the regulations but the LAPD officer spent 15 minutes flipping through his regulations book trying to find the reason he pulled us over.  He finally settled on giving me a warning about foot pegs for the rear passenger even though there were foot pegs. \n\nI took that opportunity to explain how LAPD will pull you over for no reason if your skin isn\u2019t white then look for reasons later.   I also told her arguing with the police officer that there was no reason to pull us over wasn\u2019t going to help the situation at all and just to stay silent and say sir when spoken to so we can go home quicker."}
