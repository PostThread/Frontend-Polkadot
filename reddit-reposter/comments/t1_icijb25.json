From what I can tell those are black angus as well. Those cows are tough as shit. We\u2019ve had multiple heat wave far in excess of both temperatures, humidity, and duration compared to what KS has just experienced. Those cows are worth around)$1,200-1,600 a piece and that\u2019s a big insurance pay off or a huge F\u2019up. Those cows didn\u2019t all die at the same time due to heat. My guess it was either NO WATER or something more sinister."}
