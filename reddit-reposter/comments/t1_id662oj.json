For 4 years now I've worked as a second shift server/bartender, making appx $5.00/hr and surviving off the kindness of strangers and their tips. With how expensive childcare is, it's been a weird balancing act of going part time inconsistently for both kids\n\nNow that both kids have been accepted into full time childcare, my days free up. Childcare is so expensive that I'm just gonna pick up a second job during the day to cover expenses and continue bartending 3 nights a week, and PRAY that's enough to settle all the current liabilities that exist in my life.\n\nI'm ALSO studying for my bachelor's in accounting and finance, which has been remote up until this point, but it's only a matter of time before I have one or two random courses I'm forced to do in person, which I'll have to work around two jobs and two kids, but fortunately that won't be a thing until at least the Spring.\n\n\nI'm an absolute neurotic mess, I struggle to afford absolutely anything in my life, and the light at the end of the tunnel is more work during my newly minted \"free time\".\n\nI'm so far from ok I can't keep putting it into words without continuing my current march towards depression."}
