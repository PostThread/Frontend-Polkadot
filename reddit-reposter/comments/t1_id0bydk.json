First, the diaphragm is contracting and creating the vacuum that sucks air in. Second, the ribs are expanding in a \u201cbucket handle\u201d movement to increase the area. The entire chest cavity goes to a negative pressure for a moment, including the heart, so venous return is momentarily boosted. Next, the diaphragm relaxes and the chest muscles move back, creating a positive pressure in the chest cavity and expelling air."}
