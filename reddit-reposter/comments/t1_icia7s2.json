Jesus told him to put his sword away and said, \u201call those who draw the sword will die by the sword.\u201d  Jesus then went willingly to be tried and eventually crucified.  I am SO SICK of these moronic, right-wing, fake Christian lunatics using Jesus and the Bible as a political tool when they get everything so embarrassingly backwards."}
