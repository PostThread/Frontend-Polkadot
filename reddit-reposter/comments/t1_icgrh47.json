It was fun speedrunning the first major boss, who we defeated in a single turn of combat because we were ten levels higher than the last time we fought him. What wasn\u2019t as fun was trying to rebuild our relationships with other NPCs, like the adopted daughter of my friend\u2019s PC, or a village of monsters that we befriended last time. \n\nLuckily, beating the bbeg\u2019s ass a second time fixed things and people remember us now.\n\nBut our DM decided to pull the JRPG trope of \u201cthe bbeg was actually trying to stop some even greater threat, now it\u2019s up to you to stop it\u201d so now we\u2019re on quest 3 (or technically 4 since the first major boss was quest 1)"}
