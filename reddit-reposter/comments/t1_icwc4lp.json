And he said *Because I know you love them, and* [*underlined in red*] *seeing you smile is worth a few pickles.* [*end underline*]\n\nAnd my heart just melted, because for years I whole-heartedly believed this man hated pickles.\n\nBut no.\n\nHe loves them.\n\nHe just loves me more.\n\n---\n\n^^I'm&#32;a&#32;human&#32;volunteer&#32;content&#32;transcriber&#32;and&#32;you&#32;could&#32;be&#32;too!&#32;[If&#32;you'd&#32;like&#32;more&#32;information&#32;on&#32;what&#32;we&#32;do&#32;and&#32;why&#32;we&#32;do&#32;it,&#32;click&#32;here!](https://www.reddit.com/r/TranscribersOfReddit/wiki/index)"}
