(Rather his wife did)\n\nHis wife hates me, and he\u2019s the type that grovels at her feet and actually lied about my mother being there with us when I saw him a couple years ago, so she wouldn\u2019t be upset.\n\nWe\u2019re both 32 year old men\u2026I hugged that guy when he found out his real mother was murdered. He lived in my house for 2 years for free, called my mom, \u2018Mom\u2019 ate with us, slept on my couch.\n\nShowed up to show me his new house a couple years ago, pulled that shit I said above and never spoke to me again.\n\nHurts man."}
