I lived in relative luxury - my parents were the ones who lived through the Depression and then WWII, etc.  \n\nIf anything - I always told my kids (millenials) I had it easier than them.  No one knew what an AR-15 was when I was growing up- the wildest thing about school was the new substitute who liked to wear miniskirts (THAT was wild, at the time) - and I literally ran around the neighborhood, unsupervised, from dawn till dusk every single day in the summer.\n\nWhen I was 6 years old.\n\nIn Los Angeles.\n\nAnd nobody cared, because every kid was doing the same thing."}
