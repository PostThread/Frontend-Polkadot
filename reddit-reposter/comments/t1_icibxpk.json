The shitty thing too, is that this parent will try to sue them for the father\u2019s mistake. I\u2019m curious if the parent lied to the pre op nurse as it\u2019s a common question to ask if they\u2019ve eaten or drank prior to the procedure. If they lied, it\u2019s a horrible mistake that could cost them his daughter."}
