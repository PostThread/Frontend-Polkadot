No one really liked working with him. Thats what I was told by people who have worked with him, back when I worked around astronauts more. So I have never found this story cute, just annoying that it wasn't with cooler astronauts. Its been years since I asked but the whole premise wasn't some clandestine star crossed lovers bullshit, it threatened to damage crew moral.\n\nIn other news though, it was the same mission, if I recall, as spacelab, which was this added module in the cargo bay, connected to the airlock with a kink in the passage that essentially added an entire extra private room to the crew space. So there is a HUGE consensus that they are the first people to have sex in space."}
