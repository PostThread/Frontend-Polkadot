Every single Tuesday, like clockwork, I would call in an order so it'd be ready and waiting for me to walk over and pick it up. It was a small shop and the same girl worked the pickup every day. This went on for almost a year. Got my gyro, went back to the office. \n\nOne weekend I decided to take my wife there because I was always talking about how good the food was. We sit down and, lo and behold, the girl who normally did pickup was our waitress. She walked over and said, \"Oh hey (my name), how are you doing today? Is this your wife you've told us about?\" \n\nMy now ex-wife proceeded to look across the table at me, stone faced, and in front of the waitress ask, \"How the fuck does she know your name? You fucking her?\" \n\nCompletely out of nowhere. The waitress was mortified, I was embarrassed, and the marriage was over shortly after. She had always been a little insecure at times but this was just an entirely new level of insecure. At no point in our brief marriage had I ever cheated on her or given her reason to assume I'd cheated. But from that day forward, I was accused of cheating on a regular basis and was grilled for even the tiniest interactions with females. \n\nIf this video reminds you of your relationship: run. I promise you, you won't regret leaving."}
