It was humid as hell and they'd cracked a door for a box-fan to create some circulation in the room.\n\nMeanwhile, Athens has a new, beautiful, modern, functional Acropolis-based National Archeological Museum with a room ready and set aside for them.\n\nI love England, but Fuck the vestigial British Empire."}
