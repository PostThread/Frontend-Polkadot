I JUST resigned from United Health Care. I didn't even make it out of the three month training. It's so micromanaged, and the policies are so controlling and outrageous I couldn't even consider staying. They should have called, but as someone who dealt with them through employment even for a bit..they really do not care. Mark you down as no call no show and hire the next cog to run their machine. I hope you and especially your sister the best am sending you positivity from Florida. <3"}
