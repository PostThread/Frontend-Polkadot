Reminds me of my childhood a bit.\n\nI always asked my parents to take me to the movies but we were very poor and we lived way out in the country. The movie theater was too far and too expensive. \n\nMy dad felt bad about not being able to take us, so he made a ticket window out of cardboard. It had a big marquee where he pinned the movie 'choices' (It would be whatever was playing on TV that night for kids and a second choice that we would no-way ever choose. So it was like: \"Now Showing: Disney's Lady and the Tramp /// Now Showing: Brocolli- THE MOVIE\"\n\nWe would come in and pay for a ticket with monopoly money and then make our way to moms concession stand with popcorn and (homemade) fruit roll-ups.  Dad would say \"hurry the movies about to start\" and we would rush to the living room couch where dad would always say \"is someone sitting here??\" And no matter what you'd say (nooo I'm saving this seat)  he'd say \"ok thanks\" and plop down. I'd giggle. My sister would groan. And mom would drop the house lights and we would watch a movie as one big happy family at the theater. \n\nThose were the days."}
