There's a whole management style called servant leadership. If you can, get a job at one of those companies, do it. And leave the old money grubbing corporations to rot. \n\nAlso as a consumer if you find a servant leadership business you'll likely get better value from them than anywhere else. My mechanic is a servant leadership company and its the only mechanic I trust."}
