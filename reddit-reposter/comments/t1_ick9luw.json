No one comments on it or thinks it\u2019s weird\n\nThis implies she has *always* been more powerful than him, and that the reason she gets kidnapped so often by Bowser is that she allows it.\n\nI guess that one time was different because there was already another villain attacking the kingdom at that moment. Peach had more important things to do than their usual Friday routine."}
