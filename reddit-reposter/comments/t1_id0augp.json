It\u2019s actually remarkable, because the beak isn\u2019t connected in any way, it\u2019s two separate pieces and yet the pattern is contiguous, almost as if it was formed closed as a closed thing and someone sawed it to get the mouth. Fact that it is never connected and a pattern like that forms is nuts. Is it ever fuesed together even in the embryo? How does this even happen?"}
