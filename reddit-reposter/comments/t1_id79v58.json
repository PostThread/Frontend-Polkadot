An 18 year old girl was driving a pickup truck and was speeding on the freeway. She was in the far left lane and went to pass someone on the right, that person got over at the same time she did, so the girl jerked back to the left too quick and lost control. She tried to correct herself back to the right and rolled her truck a good 2-3 times across the entire freeway from left to right. She somehow didn't hit anyone else, but she was ejected. Her truck ended up on its side all the way over on the shoulder, but she was in one of the lanes. This all happened in front of me like 3 car lengths ahead of me.\n\nI pulled over as fast as I could and jumped out with 911 on the phone. Another person pulled over behind her truck, and ran to her and checked her pulse, but he couldn't find a pulse. Paramedics and police came and they worked on her, and supposedly got her heart started again, but the officer took my statement and the next day called me to let me know she was brain dead and the family decided to pull the plug.\n\nIt was pretty surreal when it was all happening and the worst part of it was people driving by taking pictures and videos. Her family found a video that showed my work van in it that I was driving at the time, and called our store to talk to me. They were so nice and so appreciative of me stopping and trying to help. I felt so bad for them.\n\nI sometimes still think about her, and wish I would have done CPR. I don't think it would have helped her, but there is a little part of me that thinks maybe it would have, so I do regret not doing it.\n\nPlease wear a seat belt."}
