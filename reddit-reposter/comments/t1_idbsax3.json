And how we hold them accountable. It starts bottom up. Voting makes a difference when we hold people accountable at the local levels. I have seen this as I had to work to change something in my neighborhood. Everyone supported it but nobody but me showed up when it came time to get to the meeting. I implore everyone to show up for City council and to show up for Neighborhood Associations. It\u2019s eye opening to see how much can change participating at these levels alone.\n\nEdit:autoincorrect"}
