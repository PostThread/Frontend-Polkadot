Its hard to disprove you arent advantaged like Lia Thomas and you cant blame the athlete for taking advantage if its within regulation.\n\nYou'll probs see this regulation be pulled through on a national level and the olympic committtee soon. Its not an ideal solution, but i do think its reasonable."}
