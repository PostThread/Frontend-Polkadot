I had a friend, hard core Trumpite.  When Melania copied her speech from Michelle Obama they blamed it on a plant, a liberal spy who wrote her speech.  I scoffed at that in the presence of my friend, saying what a stupid lie it was like when they'd blame an intern for the stupid things Ol' Cheeto Hair tweeted during the campaign. My friend became livid, apoplectic even. He could not bear to hear his Great Leader even questioned."}
