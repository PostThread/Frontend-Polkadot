I worked in AWS in the data centers. Plans got leaked that they were going to be hiring \"unskilled\" labor for network deployments and pay them a little above minimum wage for it. The higher ups wanted to cut labor costs so they started forcing out the senior members of our team in the most Amazon way possible. Me and every other higher paid senior level deployment tech was given quadruple our normal work loads with less than half the time to do it in. And if you got the work done, they just racked you up with new projects. \n\nThe whole plan backfired spectacularly as it triggered an exodus to other teams or out of the company once as most of the senior staff were nearly all gone. They lost the majority of their institutional knowledge in a few weeks and productivity apparently tanked from what I was told. They raised the hourly rate for everyone left to above what the higher level techs were making before to try to stop the bleeding but people are still bailing. And they cant find anyone to hire cause word has gotten out that the AWS DCs are literal sweatshops (the Temps inside are so high in summer that it's not an uncommon sight to see an ambulance at a DC due to a worker passing out due to heat stroke inside the datahalls) \n\nFuck them. I was 3 weeks before my next stock vest and ended up losing 10k overall in difference between the severance and what I would have made from the stocks."}
