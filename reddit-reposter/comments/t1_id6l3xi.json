Sure I can be big and strong, but if I want to hug my bro, I can and will hug my bro. If I want to share my feelings with my bro, I can and do without any shame. Lil kiss on the cheek goodbye because I won't see my bro for however long shouldn't make me less manly. So it doesn't.\n\nOne of the many reasons why these movies are my favorites of all time."}
