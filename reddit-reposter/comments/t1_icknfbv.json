Been told that the truck was having some issues, had been parked at the top of that hill for about an hour, then this. The investigators told us they think that one of the emergency brakes failed, none of the operators were in the truck when it went. It destroyed my neighbors house, we are all very fortunate that no one was hurt or worse. Because of the excessive heat, none of our kids were outside playing or they would have been right in its path playing in the yards."}
