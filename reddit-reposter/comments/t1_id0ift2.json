My brother in law got covid last year and it affected his brain. His mental capacity is still shot a year later. He\u2019s just not the same person anymore\n\nEdit: people asking to elaborate.\n\nI don\u2019t know the specifics of how it affected his brain, but that\u2019s what we were told when he finally got to the ER. My brother in law wasn\u2019t vaccinated when he got it, and he was ill for about a week or more before being treated. I\u2019m not sure if he ever lost smell or taste, but he became delusional; thinking he could outrun cars, or fall from heights and not be injured, thinking god was giving him superpowers, etc. After covid, i suppose he became a bit more distant. He seemed like he was in a constant haze, like not able to recognize what he\u2019s doing, or what\u2019s going on. My mother in law would talk to my wife and i about him, him being right next to her, and he wouldn\u2019t even realize we were talking about him. He definitely stopped being as jovial as he normally was. He seems to be doing better now and is starting to seem less hazy, but he\u2019s still not how he was pre-covid, and it\u2019s been almost a year now\n\nEdit 2: people saying this sounds more like an unrelated mental illness\n\nI understand, it sounds more manic or like mental illness. All i know is that he was fine, then he got really sick with cold/flu symptoms for a week or more before becoming delusional, then he went to the ER and they ran a covid antibody test that came back positive, and they did multiple physical/mental/psych tests on him and they determined that the covid had affected his brain, and they said they\u2019ve had at least 2 other patients that had something similar happen to them when they got covid and left it untreated for a period of time. He was fine, got covid, and now he\u2019s no longer fine and hasn\u2019t been for about a year now. Maybe he has latent mental issues that haven\u2019t manifested yet and the covid brought it to light temporarily, i have no idea, but the covid definitely had some sort of lasting effect. His brain probably became enflamed/engorged due to his illness being untreated for over a week, or perhaps the brain was infected directly or over time as it spread from being untreated. Either way, i trust our healthcare professionals\u2019 words more so than random laypeople on the internet."}
