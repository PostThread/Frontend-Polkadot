He was the victim of a swatting prank. Dozens of police surrounded his house. The guy came out of the door, not knowing what was going on, with his hand up, then one of the psycho cop shot and killed him from afar with a rifle. The cop wasn't even charged.\n\nPolice every where are busting their own hero mythology."}
