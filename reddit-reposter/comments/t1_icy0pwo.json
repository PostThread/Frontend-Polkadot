I don't understand why these studies assume Tesla doesn't grow though.  They have the margins to do so, more than any other maker.\n\nIt's still far from proven they can make money like Tesla has been designed to do - they will have to vertically integrate as the supplier model doesn't work in rapidly innovating EV manufacturing."}
