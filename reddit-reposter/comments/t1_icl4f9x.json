We had four meetings I remember clearly\n\nJune we almost broke a record for production. The best June though in over thirty years.\n\nJuly we set the record for production. Highest monthly profits in history.\n\nAugust we BROKE the July record. Highest monthly profits in history.\n\nNovember we get told no bonuses will be coming for the holidays. They blamed low profit margins and expenses. President got a new Jaguar though because he would drive it in. Also out thank you party where we literally did an employee potluck was cancelled. So our half day reward for the potluck was also cancelled."}
