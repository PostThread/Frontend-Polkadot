Cut them how they naturally fall but make sure to use your fingers to hold (not pull) the hair so you get a straight line, start in the middle and cut outwards (helps keep both sides equal). Always a triangle section with the highest point facing towards the back of your head (should stop before the middle top) . Lastly, never cut past the second knuckle, brush out the hair so it\u2019s resting normally and pick up the next section with a bit of the last (previously cut) section of hair as a guide.\n\ntldr; tips for cutting straight across bangs so you don\u2019t end up like this (I definitely did this as a kid and in hair dressing school).\n\nedit: Thank you for the upvotes and the award! Also i\u2019m very happy everyone is sharing tips and stories, this is what i\u2019d hoped to happen :D I really needed a wholesome interaction like this right now. Thank you."}
