They have such a great vibe. MCs at each side of the stadium lead their fans in dedicated songs for each player, the game moves at a steady pace, you can get a full meal and a large beer for only 10 - 15 bucks, and there are lots of street vendors outside where you can have awesome street food and drink with friends and fans.  \n\nWhen I came back to the states and went to one of our televised MLB games, it was such a lackluster experience in comparison."}
