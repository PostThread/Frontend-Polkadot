He said he held officers back from the door to the classrooms for 40 minutes to avoid gunfire.When a custodian brought a large key ring, Arredondo said he tried dozens of the keys but none worked.  \n>  \n>But Arredondo was not trying those keys in the door to classrooms 111 and 112, where Ramos was holed up, according to the law enforcement source. Rather, he was trying to locate a master key by using the various keys on doors to other classrooms nearby, the source said.\n\nThis is one of the saddest most depraved situations I've ever heard of and now the guy is in a council.  SAD town, SAD world.  No excuses for this... none."}
