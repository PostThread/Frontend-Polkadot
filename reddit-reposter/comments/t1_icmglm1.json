By that i mean whatever it is you guys eat in California.\n\nAlso, junk food.\n\nAlso, I might have had the two best cakes of my life in the US. One was a carrot cake at a wedding, another one was a burnt-almond cake.\n\nAlso, everything that comes with Thanksgiving: the turkey, the mashed potatoes, the deviled eggs.\n\nAlso, apple pie\n\nI edited this post and will continue if more stuff comes to mind. The US doesn't get enough credit for food, especially by italians"}
