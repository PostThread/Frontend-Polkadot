As a kid I would visit an East London market with my mum and go straight to the bootleg Mega Drive and SNES stall. The guy had everything. I mean everything.  \nA misconception in recent years that original games back then were not so easy to clone. I can tell you that is very much bullshit, lol. I was playing every major Mega Drive and SNES game some weeks to months before they even released over here."}
