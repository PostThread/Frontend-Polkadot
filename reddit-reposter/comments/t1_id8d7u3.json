We block Russian property deals on security grounds all time in Finland. \n\n\nThe problem has been when we didn\u2019t block them, like an oligarch who bought an island in a shipping lane and built 7 piers on it, high tech comms systems and a helipad with \u201cwind breakers\u201d (fortifications). Military and police raided it - it was being setup as a secret Russian spec ops site. He did it via a Finnish company and some greedy local collaborators to act as sham directors so it flew under the radar initially. \n\nThere\u2019s also a \u201choliday village\u201d for Russians being built right next to the locks of a major canal. Absolutely no tourism value in that area. Also has mysterious fortified helipads and deep basements and satellite and radio comms. Probably will be raided soon too."}
