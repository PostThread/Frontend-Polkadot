Planting drugs. Illegally entering homes. Raping women. Extorting the poor and homeless. Beating PoC. Everyone yells \"enough is enough\" every time.\n\nBut nothing is done. Nothing changes. Police are still thugs behind the shield of the corrupt govt.\n\nThen Uvalde happens. We find out they tried to hide the footage from being released. Much like the thousands of stories and videos we've heard and seen before except this time their incompetence cost them the lives of children. More info is coming out daily that the Uvalde police are corrupt pieces of shit who are trying to cover their tracks.\n\nI'm no revolutionary. I'm not a political scientist. I don't know how to fix all these issues because there's so much to it... But fuck, something has got to give.\n\nIf I lost my children in a school shooting only to find out the cops did nothing or possibly shot and killed a child I'd be at the doorstep with torch in hand."}
