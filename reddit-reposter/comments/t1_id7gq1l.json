Many times in films they struggle to write kids.  They end up sounding either like little adults, or just caricatures.  Lilo comes off as a believable kid.\n\nAnd the dynamic she has with her sister is the most interesting part of the film to me honestly.  It more complex and nuanced than most films like this would have made it.  And Nani is very sympathetic in her own right."}
