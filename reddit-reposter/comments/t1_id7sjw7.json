The DOJ and the Select Committee will be going through the tapes to find more witnesses to be deposed. Then the videos will also become collaboration for other witness testimony. It is possible that actual crimes may have been captured on tape. There was enough evidence to indict up to this point, now there is another layer of evidence pointing to the collective guilt of Trump, his campaign, his inner circle, and a larger group of Republicans."}
