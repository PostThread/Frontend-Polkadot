My friend works for the state geological survey and they did a survey last year showing the drought conditions of Kansas and it\u2019s in a basically \u201call hope is lost\u201d situation. We have depleted the ancient aquifers under the plains dry and they aren\u2019t refilling fast enough. On top of that we are going from average 60\u00b0F weather to over 100\u00b0F weather in a matter of a few days. The farmers and especially the cows can\u2019t adapt to weather changes that quickly."}
