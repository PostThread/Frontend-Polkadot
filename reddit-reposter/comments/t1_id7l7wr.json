Holder\u2019s company, AJH Films, confirmed to\u00a0Rolling Stone\u00a0on Tuesday that he has been subpoenaed, will sit for an interview with the panel on Thursday, and has \u201cfully complied with all of the committee\u2019s requests.\u201d\n\n>In some of the highest ranks of the Trumpworld diaspora \u2014 including among several who testified before the Jan. 6 committee \u2014 news of the documentarian cooperating with the congressional panel (and also potentially having reams of behind-the-scenes footage of Trump\u2019s crusade to nullify the 2020 election) came as a bizarre surprise. \u201cWhat the fuck is this?\u201d a former top Trump 2020 official messaged\u00a0Rolling Stone\u00a0on Tuesday after seeing the\u00a0Politico\u00a0item.\n\n>Another former senior official on the reelection team insisted that the first time several members of the Trump campaign leadership even heard of the documentary was when\u00a0Politico\u00a0reported the committee had subpoenaed the Holder. A third ex-official simply said, \u201cTerrible idea,\u201d and pleaded baffled ignorance to the doc project.\n\n>Two former senior Trump administration officials, who were still working in the administration after the Jan. 6 riot, also claimed that they each had no idea the documentary was being shot in that timeframe, reportedly intimate access to Trump, his vice president, his family members, and his White House.\u00a0Stephanie Grisham, who at that time was chief of staff to First Lady Melania Trump, told\u00a0Rolling Stone\u00a0she wasn\u2019t aware of this documentary project either.\n\n>In other words: many of the people actually\u00a0running\u00a0Trump\u2019s reelection operation are now saying they somehow had zero clue that an entire documentary was being filmed largely\u00a0about Trump and his reelection campaign. And now the fruits of that doc are being mined for evidence by the congressional committee investigating Trump and his multi-pronged efforts to shred the American democratic order.\n\n>Holder\u00a0released a statement\u00a0later on Tuesday noting that he had \u201cunparalleled access\u201d to Trump and others over the final six weeks of his presidency and that he has \u201cnever-before-seen footage\u201d of the Capitol attack. \u201cWhen we began this project in September 2020, we could have never predicted that our work would one day be subpoenaed by Congress,\u201d he wrote, adding that he had \u201cno agenda coming into this\u201d and only \u201cwanted to better understand who the Trumps were and what motivated them to hold onto power so desperately.\u201d\n\n>The\u00a0subpoena\u00a0from the committee requests that Holder turn over any \u201craw footage\u201d filmed by him or his team on Jan. 6, 2021, as well as footage of interviews from Sept. 2020 through the present with President Trump, his children, Jared Kushner, and Vice President Mike Pence. The committee also requested any footage in Holder\u2019s possession \u201cpertaining to discussions of election fraud or election integrity surrounding the November 2020 presidential election.\u201d\u00a0\n\n>As a filmmaker, Holder is best known for his documentary\u00a0Keep Quiet, which covered far-right Hungarian politician Csanad Szagedi\u2019s\u00a0fall from power. Szagedi was the deputy head of Hungary\u2019s\u00a0radical nationalist Jobbik party, and after years of catering to anti-semitic groups was forced to resign when his own Jewish ancestry became public knowledge.\n\n>Nick Quested, an Emmy-winning filmmaker, cooperated with the committee and\u00a0testified publicly\u00a0on June 9 regarding his time embedded with the Proud Boys, a far-right group involved in the attack on the Capitol.\u00a0\n\n>It\u2019s unclear if Holder will testify during the committee\u2019s public hearings, but given that he was asked to provide footage by June 16 and is cooperating, it\u2019s not out of the question that the committee may play some of his footage at an upcoming hearing."}
