My prerequisite for discussing him is that they have to admit he's a liar. \n\nSome of them will freely admit that he is, but say they still support him for a variety of reasons (usually that all politicians lie and they like that he's lying for what they perceive as their common cause). I'm completely fine with that. I disagree, but at least there's some semblance of rationality to that view.\n\nBut I won't even engage with the ones that swear he's honest and honorable."}
