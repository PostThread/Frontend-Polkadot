Peta has such a high kill rate because they euthanise pets brought to them by overfilled no-kill shelters and private people who cannot afford a vet, because they do it for free as opposed to vets.\n\nThink of PETA what you want but to say they kill animals for profit is a lie perpetrated by the lobbyist Center for Consumer Freedom (see John Olivers segment on astroturfing)."}
