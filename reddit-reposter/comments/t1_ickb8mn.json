Erdo\u011fan is up for re-election next year. Rhetoric around oppressing Kurds is often popular. However, the tide is changing in Turkey. The opposition mayors of Ankara and Istanbul are both currently polling much higher than Erdo\u011fan. \n\nI see FI/SE accession to NATO as delayed by internal politics in Turkey and not a realistic outcome of all this cock-blocking.\n\n**Edit:** A lot of angry Turks responding here, inaccurately talking about how Sweden and Finland supports terrorism by sending funds to YPG. This is wrong because YPG have not been proscribed as a terrorist organisation by the EU or NATO.\n\nOn the other hand, the Muslim Brotherhood and Hamas have been proscribed as a Foreign Terrorist Organisation (FTO). Despite this, **Turkey supports and backs both financially.**\n\n**Edit 2:**\n\nAsk yourselves these questions:\n\nHas YPG been designated an FTO under international law? Yes or no?\n\nDoes Turkey actively support designated FTOs under international law? (Muslim Brotherhood and Hamas) Yes or no? \n\nWhich FTOs does Sweden support going  against international law?\n\nWhich FTOs does Finland support going against international law?"}
