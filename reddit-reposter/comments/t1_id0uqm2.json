She's been with that kid since they were 14 and they are now married with 2 beautiful children but she was ready to throw hands if he had been foolish enough to peek out from under the bed while I was prancing around the room mid-change talking about not having undies on lol. He promised up and down that he didn't look and the poor darling was under there getting stung by ants that had made their way in through the window by the bed. Bless his heart."}
