All of it, include the long-haul illness.\n\nHonigsbaum M, Krishnan L. Taking pandemic sequelae seriously: from the Russian influenza to COVID-19 long-haulers. Lancet. 2020 Oct 31;396(10260):1389-1391. doi: 10.1016/S0140-6736(20)32134-6. Epub 2020 Oct 12.

Although H Franklin Parsons, the medical investigator for England's Local Government Board, completed his final report on the \u201c1889\u201392 epidemic\u201d in 1893, further severe recrudescences were observed in 1893, 1895, 1898, and 1899\u20131900. \n\nAnd what happened when nothing systemic was done to curb infection?
