He did not want to walk for college graduation. Mom reeeeeally wanted him to attend the ceremony. He is very blond so he dyed his mustache black so you could see it and then got a perm. He looked like a 70s porn star lolol. Mom found it hilarious and now routinely posts Facebook memories of this so I\u2019m not sure who won that battle haha."}
