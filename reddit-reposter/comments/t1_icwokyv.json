It was towards the end of the day and things were wrapping up, he had just finished speaking to somebody and I was able to go right up to him. He asked me if I wanted him to sign anything. I replied \"No, sir. I just want to shake the hand that bitch slapped Bob Kane.\" His eyes lit up immediately, he got a real kick out of it. I knew the story but he insisted on retelling it for me and I could not have been more thrilled to listen."}
