The academy\u2019s dashboard has been updated daily ever since, and now pegs that number at 25 million.  \n\nEven this may be a major undercount. The dashboard calculation assumes that 30 percent of COVID patients will develop lasting symptoms, then applies that rate to the 85 million confirmed cases on the books. Many infections are not reported, though, and blood antibody tests suggest that 187 million Americans had gotten the virus by February 2022. (Many more have been infected since.) If the same proportion of chronic illness holds, the country should now have at least 56 million long-COVID patients. That\u2019s one for every six Americans.\n\n---\n\n Please reply to OP's comment here: https://old.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/vg9boo/long_covid_could_be_a_mass_deterioration_event_a/id0b0m4/"}
