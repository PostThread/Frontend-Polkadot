Meanwhile they damaged the doors to the point they couldn't be opened without cutting them and redoing the door frame of the mobile home. The guys they were supposed to be serving however were busy hiding or getting rid of the drugs and meth lab they had going in the property behind theirs. Side note, my grandparents had their address on both the home, and a large rock by their front gate clearly visible, and was caught by the security camera on my parents property too. The sheriffs dragged their feet on repaying the damages done to their home as well. Additional notes this happend 20+ years ago."}
