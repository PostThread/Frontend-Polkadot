When I was six, I was at the mall during Christmas time. There was this gigantic, animatronic teddy bear, and he'd turn his head and talk to people. He turned to me and said \"hello,\" so I replied \"KISS MY BUTT!\" He sat still for a moment, then asked, \"what did you say?\" I immediately froze in fear... I ran the other direction behind the bear, and it's head turned as far is it could go, \"and he asked where I was going... I about shit myself. My mom later told me it was a guy inside, controlling the movements and voice. Fucked me up."}
