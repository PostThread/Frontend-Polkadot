My mom was a single mom and we didn't have much for awhile. She would do special little things similar to this. One night on the first night of Hanukkah she bundled us up made us hot cocoa and put my siblings and I in a long pull sled and looked at the Christmas lights. That night I will never forget it was so magical. Kids remember those things the most, they won't remember how much you spent."}
