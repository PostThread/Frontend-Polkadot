My point is that it doesn't seem to me that the president of that college is anti-gay.  It is probably a school policy since the school is religious(I'm guessing).  The guy there looks genuinely happy with the students, who knows, maybe he supports their movement.  What I really want to say is, don't judge people just because of what other think of them.  Everybody deserves respect and compassion unless it is proven otherwise."}
