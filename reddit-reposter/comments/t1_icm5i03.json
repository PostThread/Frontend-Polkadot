At the start, the frame rate of the capture is exactly equal to the blades rate of rotation or some harmonic of it. As the rotor speeds up, each image capture can see less of the distance traveled by the blades rotation and we see it appear a little bit ahead of where it \"was\". \n\nGoogle aliasing or wagon wheel effect if you want to see more videos like this."}
