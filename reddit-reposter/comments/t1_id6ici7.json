Soon the universe will catch on to the fact that his soul left his body decades ago, they will bury him with all the honors and a line will from of people who promised themselves that they would live long enough to piss on his grave.\n\nThey will need a medical tent nearby to take care of all the people who held on for years and decades longer than they though they would have to just for that one moment and keel over shortly after they relive themselves, having lost their purpose in life.\n\nThere will be people with walker and wheelchairs who will rip out their catheters without a care about their future because they just hung on for that one moment.\n\nThey will need drainage ditches and ambulances waiting and that is just for those who come to his grave in person."}
