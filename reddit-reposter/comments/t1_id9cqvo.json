Did you know she also invented Smartfood Popcorn?\n\nhttps://www.mashed.com/246231/the-untold-truth-of-annies-homegrown/\n\n\"Annie Withey was never all that interested in the business side of things, and after Smartfood was sold to Frito-Lay in 1989 for about $15 million, she decided to keep experimenting with her white cheddar powder. Forbes states that Withey began using the powdered cheese to top other foods, including Kraft brand macaroni. After finding that it could be used to make a really tasty boxed mac & cheese, Withey and her husband began to conceive a new food business. They first tested their boxed macaroni and cheese by selling it at festivals and food co-ops throughout the East Coast.\""}
