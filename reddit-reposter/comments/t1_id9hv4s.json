If she does, then she remembers when BBC heavily edited footage to imply the miners were extremely violent and the police were defending themselves\n\n\nThe Battle of Orgreave was a violent confrontation on 18 June 1984 between pickets and officers of the South Yorkshire Police (SYP) and other police forces, including the Metropolitan Police, at a British Steel Corporation (BSC) coking plant at Orgreave, in Rotherham, South Yorkshire, England.It was a pivotal event in the 1984\u20131985 UK miners' strike, and one of the most violent clashes in British industrial history.\n\nJournalist Alastair Stewart has characterised it as \"a defining and ghastly moment\" that \"changed, forever, the conduct of industrial relations and how this country functions as an economy and as a democracy\".Most media reports at the time depicted it as \"an act of self-defence by police who had come under attack\". In 2015, the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) reported that there was \"evidence of excessive violence by police officers, a false narrative from police exaggerating violence by miners, perjury by officers giving evidence to prosecute the arrested men, and an apparent cover-up of that perjury by senior officers\"."}
