Back in the day the North Koreans used a ferry, Man Gyong Bong 92, that was intended to transport passengers and cargo between North Korea and Japan. What it actually was used for was to smuggle illegal items to and from Japan such as drugs ,weapons, cash, missile parts, and other technology (Digital cameras, Game Consoles, Computers, etc) that was bought by North Korean Agents legitly from electronic stores that could easily be modified/broken down for military use."}
