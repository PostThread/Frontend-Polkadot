Despite being absolutely adorable, chameleons are advanced level reptiles, definitely not a first reptile pet. \n\nI used to work at a pet store and it was so bad people made a petition for us to stop selling them. They are just very difficult to care for.\n\nIf you really want to get into reptile husbandry, I recommend either a ball python or a leopard gecko. Prepare to spend a decent amount of money getting them set up, and a lot of time doing research.\n\nOnce they are set up and adults though, they are very low maintenance pets. My leopard gecko eats every three days, I only need to clean his tank twice a year(bioactive set up) and his heat lights are automated."}
