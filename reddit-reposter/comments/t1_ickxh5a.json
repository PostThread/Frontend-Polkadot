If your pits really smell, scrub them with a glycolic acid or salicylic acid type facewash like once or twice a month. That helps. And use a deodorant that says antibacterial, not just antiperspirant. \n\nYou can also soak/wash your clothes in an antibacterial laundry detergent. Found that helps get rid of deodorant build up on clothes. \n\nLove, A sweaty girl."}
