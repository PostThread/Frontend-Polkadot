I\u2019m the only one who counters her bs, and she\u2019s deleted me from Facebook and actively avoids functions I go to since around August 2020. We never had words with each other and the \u201cdiscussions\u201d were always civil, but they can\u2019t stand anyone with differing opinions than them. We had a contentious relationship since I was young, so I don\u2019t really miss her."}
