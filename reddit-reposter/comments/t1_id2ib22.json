It was decided that the only way was to dismember the body.\n\nThe authorities knew that the rescuers and miners can never stomach this so they sent in surgeons to cut the body up. The bodies were then wrapped in black plastic bags and passed down a human chain out of the rubbles by the miners.\n\nThey freaking showed them handling those bags.\n\nThe documentary is available on Netflix Singapore but I'm not sure if it's available internationally since it was a documentary made for our 50th year of independence.\n\nhttps://www.imdb.com/title/tt4721510/"}
