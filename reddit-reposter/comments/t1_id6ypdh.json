They're brothers with the same goal in mind. As a heterosexual female, I LOVE the touch and closeness these characters have in the books and films. Tolkien used his experience of war and the brotherhood he had there for his inspiration, so it just makes sense for these characters. Especially Frodo and Sam! I freaking love it!"}
