I mean all flowers to Dave (who is the man) but for the film and first 5 seasons of the series, although Dave Filoni was creative director, GL was the main creative lead behind the storylines, character arcs, and character creation. He had an active role throughout the series and it was created to his vision. Specific early storylines GL had a big hand in were the Destruction of Malevolence, Lair of Grevious,Battle for Ryloth, Pre Visla/Darkwatchers, Hostage Crisis,Ghosts of Mortis arc, to name a few. Anyway again, not to pull away from Dave and the other creator's contributions in any way but you'd be doing a disservice to George Lucas by not acknowledging that the series was his brainchild and created under his direct supervision"}
