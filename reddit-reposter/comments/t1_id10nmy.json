As adults we\u2019ve now told our parents and all had a good laugh. \n\nMy sister would sneak out after parents went to bed on a given night, nothing crazy but leaving at 11/11:30pm after she had checked in for curfew. The smart thing she\u2019d do, was she\u2019d leave a note on her own door that said, \u201cleft super early to go watch the sunrise with *boyfriends name*, be back after breakfast.\u201d \n\nSure, there are holes in the plan but it never failed her. She\u2019d stroll back in casually in the mid-morning, sometimes with donuts for the family. Best big sis!"}
