It was revealed today the husband of one of the killed teacher's was an officer who responded to the shooting. She called him from the room, told him she was shot and dying.\n\nWhen he attempted to go in they restrained him, took his gun and removed him from the location. Then went back to doing nothing knowing at least one person was bleeding to death in there."}
