I was going from Detroit to Vancouver Island BC and like 2 hours in from Chicago to Minneapolis(it was around 3 am), the girl next to me was falling asleep and her head started to fall by my shoulder so I just scooted over a little closer and let her use my shoulder as a pillow for the next few hours while listening to my podcasts, trying my hardest not to move and accidentally wake her up.\n\nShe apologized profusely when she woke up and noticed, I told her I didn't mind at all.\n\nWe talked the last hour or so of the ride before getting off and going our separate ways, she gave me her number though and we met up again on my way back 3 weeks later. 5 years later we got married."}
