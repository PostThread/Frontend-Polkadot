Wasted 3 years of my life with him. He used to joke that I was Steve Wozniak to his Steve Jobs. I had mad respect for Woz so I was proud of that comparison until it occurred to me one day that I was interpreting that sentiment in a completely different way than he was. His interpretation was not a term of endearment but rather he saw it as an opportunity to take advantage of my efforts."}
