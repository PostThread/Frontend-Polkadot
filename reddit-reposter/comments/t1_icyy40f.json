Already borderline poverty and now you\u2019re expecting?  Welcome to wage slavery where you and your children now literally can\u2019t afford to pull yourselves up by bootstraps.  You can\u2019t get a better job when you\u2019re constantly choosing between paying rent/eating/the next fill up to get to work. This isn\u2019t a moral issue to divide classes, it\u2019s intentional to create modern day serfs."}
