No color though ever.  They are happy make fuck ups on my hai r that I have left.  Go home and use buzzers on it and wait again 2 months. They seriously cannot screw it up to bad.  I loved military haircut that\u2019s what my wife does.  The salon students love it everyone knows me.  I tell them flat out you cannot screw it up where I won\u2019t like it because it gets buzzed at home. Calms them down a lot. Aslong as I have all pieces of my ears I tell them it\u2019s good. They cut my hair about 4 different times to see how to do it.  Nice thing is they give me free donuts or sometimes some cheeseburgers. But everyone has to learn at some point in their life."}
