In his victory speech, he declared: \u00a8Capitalism is Colombia\u00b4s economic model, and it will continue to be so\u00a8. His ideas are those of the Frankfurt school. Economic growth is linked with the social wellfare of the people.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: yes, he was a guerrilla member. But, you know what else he is? A FUCKING ECONOMIST! The people claiming that he supported chaves are so clueless, he said that when he was 20 years old. He acknowledges that Maduro is a dictator, but is willing to open the border so as to protect the bussinesses of Cucuta, the biggest city in the border with Venezuela whose economy has shrunk due to the closure of the border.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT2: Thanks for the helpful award.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT 3: He also was ambassador to Belgium when he was exiled from the country. During his stint as mayor, he provided 400,000 families with clean, drinkable water, lowered teh crime rates, and ended the killing of bulls and horses as transportation (yes, up until 2012,  in Colombia people used horses as animals for transportation. He also fucked up with the garbage for 3 days, and the city smelled like shit, for which he was deposed and later re-installed) thanks for the info i missed: u/carloselcoco"}
