In the 90's, I worked in a product development tech center for a F100 company. There were about 300-400 employees in the building (out of \\~10k for the whole company). \n\nOne day the CEO came to give a speech to congratulate us for delivering a product which would gain the company 10's on millions of dollars/year in profits.  After his rah rah speech, they opened it up to audience questions. There were a couple of typical softball questions and then one of the older engineers, who was close to retirement asks, \n\n>\"*How is it that during the shareholder call, you spoke at length about how well the company was performing and generating record performance yet in the announcements sent to employees about the bonus and salary increases, you talk about how the company is struggling as a way to justify a lower bonus multiplier and lower raises, all while your compensation increased 20%?*' \n\nThe CEO was definitely not expecting that kind of question at this kind of event and just sputtered some kind of non answer before just walking off stage, getting back in his limo and going back to his ivory tower at corporate HQ.\n\nFWIW, the CEO was on a list as one of the most overpaid CEO's in America"}
