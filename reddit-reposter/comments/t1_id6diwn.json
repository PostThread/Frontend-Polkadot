That is a ballistic shield, they're designed for forced-entries, and can withstand multiple rifle caliber bullets. While you can re-use a ballistic shield for a \"riot,\" dedicated riot shields are made of transparent plastic to allow more visibility.     \n\nFor example if you google \"Texas Riot Shield\" you get pictures of events using the same design used internationally, a transparent shield, with handles and the words \"police\" in the middle. Look absolutely nothing like a ballistic shield.    \n\nI'm not being pedantic either, a riot shield would be completely useless at Uvalde, whereas a ballistic shield is the equipment police claimed they waited an hour+ to get."}
