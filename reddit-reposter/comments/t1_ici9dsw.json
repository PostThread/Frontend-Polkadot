I conservatively get 5-10 calls or emails per week from recruiters. The first thing I do is ask them salary. If they don\u2019t give me a figure, I immediately tell them in this market I have no interest in an interview if they can\u2019t show me the salary is competitive. If they give it to me, no matter what, I tell them I don\u2019t believe that rate is market and politely suggest they increase the pay. It probably won\u2019t do anything but in my head, it means the next guy or gal will get a slightly better offer and I helped my fellow worker in some way.\n\nA few times I\u2019ve also had the recruiter come back counter with 20-30% more so it\u2019s always worth asking for more I guess, even if you don\u2019t have any interest."}
