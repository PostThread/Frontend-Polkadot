Like y\u2019all do realize the meat industry is like 1000% worse and you don\u2019t care because you love the taste of bacon and meat too much you fckn hypocrites. PETA has saved a ton of animals and are constantly lobbying and successfully closing down animal testing facilities and constantly getting other establishments that conduct animal abuse shut down.\n\ny\u2019all only hate PETA because you need a scapegoat for your disgusting habits. you know eating meat and abusing animals is wrong, you just don\u2019t care when it\u2019s inconvenient to you."}
