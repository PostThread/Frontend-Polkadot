Because shoplifters would sue the store when caught and arrested, claiming all sorts of things from injury, etc.  And employees were getting hurt by shoplifters, the corporate office decided to not attempt to stop shoplifters.  It's not well known to the public but if a store has security it actually increases the risk of injuries to customers.  So liability lawyers know that and use it in lawsuits claiming the store was at fault for having security guards. \n\nVERY quickly, the word got out they weren't arresting shoplifters and people were rolling multiple shopping cart loads of merchandize out the door on not just a daily but at times an hourly basis.  I'm convinced this was a factor in the chain going bankrupt.   How can you run a business when someone steals the profits every single day but you still have to pay rent, utilities, payroll, etc. etc?"}
