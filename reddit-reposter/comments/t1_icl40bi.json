As an economist, doing research studies, the data I could buy is incredible.  \n\nExample.  I need to know attendance at an open-gate festival.  People can enter from multiple locations since it was free.   One of the methods was buying cell phone data for the date/time we needed.  We didn't need any identifiable information, we just needed to know where you came from (zip code), how you entered the festival, the path you took through the festival, and how long you stayed at the festival.   We needed demographic infromation to make sure we had unbiased data, so the data included race, income, and age.  \n\nOptions we declined: Address, phone number, employer, length of employment, credit score, average bank balances, credit card balances, children, childrens names, data usage on phones, most common searched terms on phone, etc. etc. etc.  The list was huge.  It gets expensive.  This was just data from cell phone companies."}
