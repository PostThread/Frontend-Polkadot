Low? Were they at fault of all of them or just involved in crashes and some were the fault of the other car?\n\nHow many is that per 100k cars, and how does that compare to the rate of crashes of other similar cars? Of teslas not running autopilot? \n\nWhat's the crash rate of non-Tesla cars running cruise control? \n\nI'm not trying to make excuses for Tesla...far from it. But this number and the others presented in this article don't have enough context to be meaningful.\n\nEdit: Jeez I didn't expect such traction for this comment. Thanks for the awards, everyone."}
