As for the first one that was finished, the Alliance made three runs on the exhaust port. The first was called off before they made it to the trench, the second failed and the third was carried out by space Jesus which isn't exactly fair. All in all it sounds like a fairly effective defence when you consider the design philosophy.\n\nEdit: Response to some points people made. Some people pointed out Galen Urso's sabotage. This is again a management problem as if you let a saboteur on you team and he changes the design that's on you not the design.\nOther people said it was rediculous one shot took out the whole base. First of all see again the sabotage point. But also, single points of failure are more common then you'd think, aircraft for example have loads. You can't always engineer them out so what you have to do is make it so there's no one decision that can cause it to fail."}
