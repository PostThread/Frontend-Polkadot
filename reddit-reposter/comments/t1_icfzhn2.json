This cat lives inside the apartment building I live in. She has her own little door which she can use to go out and come in. 5 of the 19 residents leave her food but she does this only to me. She came here a couple months ago just appeared at my doorstep. Ever since the first time she saw me she made doing this a habit. I am\nnot complaining just curious. I names her Lili but I can\u2019t fully adopt her because she is a big grown up cat that is used to living out and she is in a safe place rn anyways. And my family would not let me take her in :(  I am very good with cats usually but never seen or had a cat do this to me. And she yells and grabs on my leg if I try to leave without letting her do this."}
