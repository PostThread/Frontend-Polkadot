It is a song that expresses her grief over losing the land she loves. Specifically, being illegally occupied by the United States government and having her homeland annexed to appeal to the interests of American Plantation owners v \n\nNani sings this song to Lilo, who is also being taken away by the US Government. It's a bittersweet parallel. \n\nThe final words of the song:\nE ke onaona noho ibka lipo\nOne fond embrace\nA ho'i a'e au\nUntil we meet again\n\n\"Let the sweetness dwell in the heart\nOne fond embrace\nAnd I returned\nUntil we meet again\""}
