Since the latter was raised by 0.75%, so was the RRP rate. A comparable rate will be available to retail investors soon via money market funds, but they always lag behind in a rising rate environment because their current (lower interest) holdings need to mature first before they can be replaced with higher yielding ones. This is normal, and while there is a metric ton of fukery out there, this is not a part of it."}
