(Purple one is best I think). Bottle is a pain to drink off. Normal bottles compress when you take a sip, these are too stiff to do that so you have to drink in small sips, which is annoying when you're in the middle of a training session and desperate for hydration.\n\nOverall, very gimmicky. Would love to have the drink in a regular bottle. Albeit I understand that it's an eye catcher, so probably good from a marketing perspective.\n\nEdit: as mentioned in the comments, the compression issue stems from the bottle having a sports cap, so you can't allow air in easily. And I'm not sure it's a removable cap. (Don't have a bottle now to check)\n\nEdit 2: by removable, I mean easy to remove. It's a sports drink, and I can foresee difficulties unscrewing a cap with sweaty hands. Then again, didn't try, and don't have a bottle now.\n\nEdit 3: Didn't expect this comment to cause a debate on drinking technique."}
