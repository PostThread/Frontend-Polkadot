Asked for the detailed bill, **3,750$**, for less than 45 minutes. \n\nI told the guy I'll have to call my insurer, guy got upset for some reason and said that I had to still pay upfront and *then* send it to my insurer. I told him he had no clue what he was talking about. He left and spoke to some kind of security guard while pointing at me. \n\nMy insurer faxed a paper to the front desk lady who told me I was good to go. Wished the angry guy a wonderful night and that was it. \n\n***3,750$ USD saved by paying 78$ CAD insurance through my bank.*** I'm simply not going to the U.S without this insurance, even though my credit card has one included for up to a week."}
