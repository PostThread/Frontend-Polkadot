They ultimately ruled this was \"reasonable\" because the cops knocked before forcing entry. The officers faced no action.  \n>  \n>The mother sued August of 2019. The village/officers did as you'd expect, filing for dismissal, and then requesting multiple extensions and substitutions to slow things down.  \n>  \n>In Feb of 2020, they substituted a bunch of attorneys, and re-scheduled the hearing. Before the hearing was granted, the new attorneys petitioned for a Stay Order, and the judge granted it.  \n>  \n>TL;DR: Officers got a paid vacation with no action, judge has sided with the cops and issued an indefinite stay order that prevents the case from ever being heard.  \n>  \n>[https://www.reddit.com/r/facepalm/comments/rbsvhq/comment/hnr38w4/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/facepalm/comments/rbsvhq/comment/hnr38w4/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)"}
