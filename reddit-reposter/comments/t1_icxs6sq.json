I was flipping through the photo printouts while my husband and I were checking out at the front desk. The ultrasound tech drew an arrow to what I presume was the penis and wrote \u201cIt\u2019s a boy! Congrats!\u201d And you know what? We were just as thrilled to find out that way. \n\nThat said - my 70 year old lady neighbor hosted a \u201cgender reveal\u201d party/BBQ last year, and she put a gigantic sign on her front lawn that read \u201cHERE FOR THE SEX\u201d. She\u2019s a gem."}
