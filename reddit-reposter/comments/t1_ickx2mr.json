If one is acting up, you'll be able to find it faster and diagnose it without staring at device manager. \n\nTurns out I had a faulty cable that was triggering this constantly, USBTreeView spotted an issue, identified the port, and after a bit of calculation I realized which cable to pull. Problem solved."}
