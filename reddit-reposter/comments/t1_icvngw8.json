I have no idea how I\u2019m going to afford to keep working.  Before people tell me to get a cheaper vehicle with better gas mileage, my vehicle is paid off, so I have no note, I take care of it, and it gets very good gas mileage.\n\n(Where I work could allow me to work from home, they\u2019re just being complete tools about it, and yes, I\u2019m looking for another job.)"}
