The idea is the youngest once learn from the older ones and the older ones learn to behave around younger ones and be more mellow. It's quite fascinating as every elephant becomes the leading bull for some time before being shipped back to the zoo they'll live in and apparently it has been working wonders on the tempers of teenage bulls"}
