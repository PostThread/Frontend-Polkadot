The absolute number one thing to do for losing weight is having a calorie deficit, meaning you burn more calories than you consume. Cutting out carbs and sugars *completely* will literally cause your body to eat itself for energy, breaking down not only fat but muscles as well. You'll have some really, really bad malnutrition if you keep it up, and you'll be weak and fatigued 24/7. \n\nEdit: You can actually go on very low carbs, but **only** with some extra modifications to your diet. It's not as simple as just cutting out your carbs, there's much more than that.\n\nYou need carbs and sugars. What you dont need, is extra carbs and sugars. Eat less, not none. Unless is something that's outright unhealthy, like added sugars or saturated fats, don't completely cut it out, you need that stuff for your body to properly function."}
