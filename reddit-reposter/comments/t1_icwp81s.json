I've just received word that the Emperor has dissolved the council permanently.\n\nCue the prequel trilogy with so much senate footage.\n\nAlso, interesting (and fitting) that after the Empire is formed in ROTS, the senate becomes so unimportant that we stop seeing it and only hear about it.  Even it's destruction in ANH is a mere footnote to be mentioned offhand by Tarkin."}
