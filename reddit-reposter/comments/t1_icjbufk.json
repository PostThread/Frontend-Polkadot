According to National Geographic (citing the journal\u00a0Communications Earth and Environment), engineers recently relied on animation codes that Disney used on its Oscar-winning blockbuster \u201cFrozen\u201d to prove a longstanding theory that an avalanche resulted in the deaths of the nine hikers.  \n>  \n>While researchers concluded in 2019 that an avalanche killed the hikers, the Dyatlov Pass incident continued to provoke theories.Per National Geographic: \u201cMany argued that the avalanche theory, initially proposed in 1959, still didn\u2019t seem to stack up: The team\u2019s tent encampment was cut into the snow on a slope with an incline seemingly too mild to permit an avalanche. There was no snowfall on the night of February 1 that could have increased the weight of the snow burden on the slope and triggered a collapse.  \n>  \n>Most of the blunt force trauma-like injuries and some of the soft tissue damage were atypical of those caused by avalanches, whose victims usually asphyxiate.\u201d**The avalanche theory has now been further supported with help from Disney\u2019s \u201cFrozen,\u201d courtesy of Johan Gaume, head of a Swiss federal technical institute named the Snow Avalanche Simulation Laboratory. Gaume \u201cwas struck by how well the movement of snow was depicted\u201d in \u201cFrozen,\u201d so he decided to ask the animators who worked on the Disney animated film for the code.**  \n>  \n>**As National Geographic reports: \u201cFollowing a trip to Hollywood to meet with the specialist who worked on Frozen\u2019s snow effects, Gaume modified the film\u2019s snow animation code for his avalanche simulation models, albeit with a decidedly less entertaining purpose: to simulate the impacts that avalanches would have on the human body.\u201dUsing the \u201cFrozen\u201d animation codes, researchers were able to create a simulation of the Kholat Saykhl avalanche.**  \n>  \n>**Gaume worked on the project with Alexander Puzrin, a geotechnical engineer at ETH Z\u00fcrich. The simulation showed that a block of snow on Kholat Saykhl could \u201chandily break the ribs and skulls of people\u201d in its path.
