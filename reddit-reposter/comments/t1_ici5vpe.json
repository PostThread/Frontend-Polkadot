Owns BNSF, which is currently engaging in anti-union practices to fend off their workers from striking against unfair scheduling policies\n2. Believes companies should pay more in taxes, all while quietly supporting corporate inversion, which allowed Burger King, another company Buffet owns a position in, to claim residence in Canada, and avoid US tax laws\n3. is the son of former US Congressman Howard Buffet. Please do not think Warren came from humble beginnings. He plays the part of the common man, but came from a background that could only guarantee success.\n4. Recently responded to Bernie Sander's call for higher pay for steel workers at a metal company he owns. Buffett's response: That is not my job.

He is a billionaire, and like all billionaires, plays the game quite well. He gives off the image of the common man and tricks people into thinking he is fighting for the common man when in reality, he is looking for every opportunity to leverage the resources he was gifted to make more money on the backs of his workers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit:\n\nThanks for the awards.\r  \n\r  \nFor those who are defending Warren Buffett or trying to justify all this, make sure he knows where to send that check to. Oh wait, he doesn't' care."}
