There are a handful of employees at my local Costco who have been there over 30 years, one guy just hit his 40th year there, and Costco is still a massively successful business/corporation. Those employees work their asses off, too, but they are still happy (probably not all, but most seem to be genuinely happy). It seems like no other companies follow that Costco model, despite the decades of demonstrated success. Something to do with the insatiable greed of other Corporations/CEOs perhaps? \ud83e\udd14"}
