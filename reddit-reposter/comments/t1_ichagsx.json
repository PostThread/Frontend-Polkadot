It started as a trick she taught him where she would pretend to shoot him and she would say \"bang bang\" the bird when then fall over and play dead. Well he figured out people clapped and laughed at the dead part so this little fucker would not wait for the \"bang bang\" he would just fall over and not get back up or be laying in the bottom of his cage like this one just waiting for someone to cheer and clap. You have no idea how many people he scared cause he would just be walking on the couch or something notice a person noticing him then just \"die\"."}
