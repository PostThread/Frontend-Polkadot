Any girls that may be going through harassment at work please realize that HR and management are not going to protect you. They are there to protect the company.\n\nMy friend worked at a hardware store and got groped by her manager. She went to HR and they removed HER from the store and put her at another one way farther away.\n\nThe fucker said she was always acting so promiscuous and probably lied about it because he talked to her about a clerical error she made. Fuck HR and fuck men who think they have a right to a woman\u2019s body."}
