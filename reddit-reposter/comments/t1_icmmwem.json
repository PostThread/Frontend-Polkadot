Now that something didn\u2019t go someone\u2019s way, they want the government to do something?\n\nNo, you don\u2019t get to have your cake and eat it too. You wanted to fuck around with an unregulated pyramid scheme, you get to suffer the consequences when your unregulated pyramid scheme screws you."}
