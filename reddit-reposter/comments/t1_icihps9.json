I was doing a corneal transplant on a patient who lied about eating breakfast.  Right after I cut off her cornea, she started vomiting and bucking.  Meanwhile, there's nothing holding the inside of her eye from becoming the outside of her eye.  So I had to grab the donor cornea and start stitching as fast as I could on a patient who was actively throwing up.  I use 10-0 nylon sutures which are thinner than an eyelash.  I saved the eye but holy hell... just skip breakfast."}
