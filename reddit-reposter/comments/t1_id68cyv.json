We explained that if he ever needed us, we would help him out in rough situations.\n\nSomehow his brain interpreted that as us saying we thought he was going to fail at life. He resented us for years and would sneer, \"Not ready for that safety net\" any time we would ask how work or school was going.\n\nIt lit a very independent and defiant streak in him. Kids are such weirdos, man."}
