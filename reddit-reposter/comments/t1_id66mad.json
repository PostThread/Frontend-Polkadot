Nobody will manage to do anything about this either and 60 days pay for being laid off? What kind of bull shit is that? In Canada you're getting at a minimum 2 weeks per year of service. Hire a lawyer and its closer to 4 weeks. I knew fellow IBMers who worked for that Godless company in the US for close to 30 years and walked with one month severance - for a lifetime. When it comes to worker protections, you guys are fucked up."}
