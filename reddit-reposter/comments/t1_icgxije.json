A friend of mine about 20+ years ago was working a jobsite and a cable was laid across the road like this. A car came by and snagged the cable and whatever the cable was attached to hit him right on the head and he was in a coma for 3 months. When he woke up he had the mentality if a 2 year old and had to relearn how to do everything. He's been fully disabled ever since and he won the largest workers compensation claim ever issued in the state."}
