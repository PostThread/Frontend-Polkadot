Maybe they are including agnostics or non-Christians.for example a recent Gallup poll said that we hit a record low of 81% believing in God. \n\nThis aligns with the % who are \u201cabsolutely certain\u201d God exists in the Pew Research religious landscape study. But that excludes even believers who are \u201cfairly certain\u201d and \u201cnot certain\u201d. The amount who do not believe in God/ don\u2019t know if they believe in God is much lower."}
