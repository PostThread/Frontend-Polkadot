The parents story raised them well and clearly did everything in their power to give them a great childhood and it shows.  \n  \nI hear so often about entitled kids throwing tantrums when they don't get what they want. It's refreshing to see this kind of appreciation. Even more so the kids, now adults, actually remember this and think of that moment as a good part of their own life."}
