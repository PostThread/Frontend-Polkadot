And the lengths conservatives would go to, to undermine the will of a few specific zip codes in favor of rural voters has now become suddenly clearer to these folks as well. \n\nI keep reminding myself, 53% of Texas white women voted for a second Trump administration. Now they may lose a fundamental right in their lifetime. Now they may be investigated if their child comes out as trans. Now they or their children may get shot for no reason at all. Now the police will lie on TV with their safety at risk while a Governor vows to do practically nothing about rape. 86% of evangelicals voted for Trump while it comes out their leaders are sexually assaulting paritioners. They voted in favor of a second term for Trump in Texas."}
