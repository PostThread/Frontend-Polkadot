I would have kept the mom too if we didn't have another cat and/or they got along.  She was 6 months old when she had a litter of 7.  5 passed.  It was one of the worst experiences of my life.  We kept the sickest one of the 2.  He is my baby.  We recently adopted a puppy.  They are the epitome of siblings.  Fight play and then clean/brush against eachother.  The kitten waits for us just inside the door when I take the puppy out to pee.  They cuddle on the centre console of the truck when we drive to our cabin.  This won't won't last long as the puppy is getting way too big to lay there soon.   It'll be interesting to see how there relationship develops as we believe the puppy will be close to, if not more than, 80 lbs."}
