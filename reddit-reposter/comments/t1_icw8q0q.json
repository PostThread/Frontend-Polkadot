The man had an entire Saga planned out the day he started seeking studios for A New Hope. Even when The Prequels started, he mentioned later on he had ideas for his own sequel trilogy which would've been a Darth Maul-led trilogy, taking ideas from comics, if he didn't stick with the original idea of it being heavily focused on Leia/the Organas. He had multiple ideas for it. Dude has a vivid imagination, I'll say that much."}
