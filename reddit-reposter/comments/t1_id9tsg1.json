Disney screwed him especially hard - he only signed on to be Genie after getting Disney to agree to never use his character in advertisements or products, because he just wanted to voice a character in a kids movie for his own children. \n\nThat didn't last much longer than it took to record his lines, and he vowed to never agree to work with Disney again after that. He was also paid really, really poorly considering the commercial success of Aladdin, success which was almost certainly directly influenced by Disney breaking their agreement and using Genie in most of the commercials and products used to advertise the film. To this day, Disney claims the controversy remains about money, and all use of Williams voice and character were used with his and/or his wife's permission. \n\nWanna know how Disney made it up to him and convinced him to come back and voice Genie again? They gave him a ***Picasso*** painting. So yeah, no matter what Disney says, they definitely pulled some shit on him, and basically sent him a priceless gift to apologize and get him back on board."}
