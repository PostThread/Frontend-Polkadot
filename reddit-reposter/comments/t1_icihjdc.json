That\u2019s going to leave some lasting damage. \n\nI remember when I was a kid playing football on my local playing field a dog ran at me. It scared me shitless. In hindsight, it was just an overexcited dog that wanted to play, but I didn\u2019t understand that. I was scared of dogs for years afterwards. Love \u2018em now. Always give them a scruffle if they approach me in the park."}
