I had just moved into a new house with a roommate, who proceeded to change the locks and pretend I didn't live there. Straight stealing my stuff in broad daylight. 1st visit with police: I was served a restraining order. Despite having a copy of my lease I wasn't even allowed to gather personal effects. Went to court 2 weeks later, obviously thrown out, go back again with a police escort. Again, with my lease to my own house in my hand, they wouldn't even so much as open a door for me. \n\nThat whole experience taught me why mafias/gangs exist in the first place. People sometimes need a higher authority to lean on, and in the absence of a legitimate one, people will seek out an illegitimate one."}
