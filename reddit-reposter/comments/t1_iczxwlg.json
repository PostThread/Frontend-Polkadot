Colombia is arguably the most important ally for the United States in it's various escapades in Latin America. The CIA used connections with the Colombian government for years to exercise missions of espionage and government interference with other Latin American nations.\n\nEven various Democratic party politicians in the United States don't support Petro because it's likely that the political upheaval will result in the end of hardline policies towards Venezuela and Cuba.\n\nThis result might be the better option in the long term for the civilian populations due to dramatic income inequality, although there is a lot that remains to be seen about how this outcome effects the region for years.\n\nEdit: I should mention as this election was essentially seen as socialist/borderline-communist leadership against moderate-slightly right leaning authoritarianism/oligarchism leadership within Colombia. Many people just chose not to vote for either candidate, but the reason these candidates beat more moderate candidates is because of contemporary issues more establishment candidates have either failed to solve or exacerbated."}
