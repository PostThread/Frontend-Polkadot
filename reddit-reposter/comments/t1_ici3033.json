They bodies were later mangled by scavenging animals.\n\nThe Dyatlov Incident is a pretty straightforward mystery in hindsight. The problem is that it happened behind the Iron Curtain, so information about it came out about it in drips and drabs, got mangled by time and endless retellings, and all primary sources are in Russian, so things gets mistranslated and misunderstood. And some of the stuff is just made up.\n\nNot to mention, the Soviet (and also to an extent American) Media's tendency to claim that anything odd that happens in Russia is caused by one Vast Conspiracy^^tm or another meant that when an actual freak accident occurs (as they sometimes do), no one believes the boy who's been crying wolf."}
