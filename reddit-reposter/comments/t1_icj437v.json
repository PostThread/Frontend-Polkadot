Same experience, told me to donate the specialized kidney meds/food/IV supplies I purchased and fully refunded me, on top of sending me beautiful flowers to honor our little guy. I now go out of my way to order from Chewy even if it means waiting a couple extra days for a delivery.  SO much respect, incredible company!"}
