(her only win over a fighter with a pro win).   \nThen she has another pull out vs Xaionan Yan citing injury.   \nThen she lost by armbar in her second fight to Montana De La Rosa.  \n~~Then she came into this fight, in the video above, 2 pounds overweight,~~ (*correction; Kim was 2 pounds over weight). did this bullshit, and then lost and started crying.        \nShe pulled out of her next fight vs Granger without clear reason.     \nGranger joked \"Maybe kassem saw the odds and thought better not\" as Granger was -900 favorite. Kassem responded saying they should fight in a carpark not only with fists, implying weapons...     \n    \nThen she got cut from the UFC for being a worthless investment.     \nNot only is Kassem a caricature of entitled trailer trash, the entire gym she trained at was a fucking joke. Founded by her ex boyfriend and his brother, their entire schtick appears to be padding records vs methheads and then trying to get signed to the UFC to get on tv in order to promote their gym... turns out getting your ass absolutely kicked by mediocre competition isn't great advertising.  Also, even their gym name is a dick move. Australian Top Team, trying to piggy back off of American Top Team as if it's a franchise or something."}
