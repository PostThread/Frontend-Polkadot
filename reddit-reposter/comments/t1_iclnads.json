Worked at a gas station and witnessed too many morons do this (sitting in the car not paying attention), then expect some sort of refund, like it\u2019s our fault they can\u2019t read. Most every gas pump has a sign saying \u201cdo not leave pump unattended, you are responsible for spills and leaks\u201d.\n\nEdit- it\u2019s not necessarily against the law as much as it is your liability. If this happens, you are 100% responsible for the gas and sometimes the cost of the cleanup.\n\nEdit 2- no disrespect to the poster of the video/ person this happened to. Shit happens when you least expect it. I\u2019m sure they probably go about pumping gas a little differently after that experience. Gas is too much $ to be pumping it on the ground."}
