We both make middle-class incomes. Even with all that, if we had kids we'd have to live in a way that to me defeats the whole purpose of working. I want reward for my labours. I want to be able to be moderately comfortable and have hobbies and travel occasionally. If the system gives me the choice between having that or giving it all up so I can afford to put more humans into circulation, basically living entirely to raise them for at least 18 years, I choose a life with some basic flexibility."}
