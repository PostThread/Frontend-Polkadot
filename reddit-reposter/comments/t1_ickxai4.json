I remember when I used to hold my nephews and nieces, they\u2019d just grab your face & hair and it would actually really hurt, but you didn\u2019t mind it one bit because they were just so bloody cute when they did. Like they\u2019d just grip your bottom lip and just look at you so studiously, attempting to comprehend what the heck you are; and then sometimes they giggle and laugh if you made a funny face. It\u2019s nice to see things like that happen amongst other life on this planet; doesn\u2019t matter what you are, a parent & a baby entails a universal experience."}
