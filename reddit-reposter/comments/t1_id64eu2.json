We remove all external links to prevent accidental posting of identifying information.\n\n**Rule 2: Do not post violent comments, and do not glorify violence, per TOS.** We can't take responsibility for how angry a post makes you, you need to do that. Telling us \"it was a joke bro\" is not an excuse.\n\n**Rule 7: Do not link to or post screenshots of reddit posts, reddit comments, reddit personal messages, reddit profiles, etc.** We cannot allow you to use this subreddit to harass other people on reddit. \n\n**Rule 8: No bigotry, no racism or race baiting.** It is hard to believe that we even need a rule like this. \n\n**Our rules are zero tolerance. You will be banned for breaking them.**\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
