I led hiking and kayak tours and I handled raptor rehab and led public programs with unreleasable birds. \n\nOne ranger put his hands on me while we worked together. He would slide his hands across my ass when we crossed paths in a hallway. He would shoot injured animals dead with a laugh, maiming them so that they would bleed out slowly rather than a quick death. He would block me in when were in. The office together, forcing me to come close enough to touch if I wanted to move by. \n\nThat man knew the power he held in his weapons and his status and he used them for abuse.\n\nWhen I made complaints to the head ranger at the park and then to the central office for the state, I lost my job."}
