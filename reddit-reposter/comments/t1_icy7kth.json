All he'd ever tell me about this part of the job was that the guys he helped were \"all skin and bone\". He was always one for understatement. \n\nHe much preferred the stories of being put on a charge for getting sunburnt whilst in Malaya by falling asleep on the beach and not being able to go on duty the next day. Or that he was offered the chance to go to Australia instead of shipping back to the UK for demobilisation, but he went home to his at-the-time fiance who'd left him but the letter had never got to him. Neither had the letter from his family telling him they'd moved 20 miles away. \n\nI can see why he preferred to tell the light-hearted stories."}
