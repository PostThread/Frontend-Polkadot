Eventually they'd see me in the queue and start preparing my coffee order before I got to the front. They never asked me for my name but I must of had a nickname or something.  \n \nAt one point, they hired a new barista who I had never seen before. Pulled up to the front and he looked at me and said \"You wouldn't by any chance be the guy who orders flat whites every morning?\".  \n \nThey had let him know who I was before he had even seen what I looked like. I was touched."}
