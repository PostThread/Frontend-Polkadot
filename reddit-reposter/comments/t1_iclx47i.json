In Britain we haven\u2019t yet decided how we\u2019re going to protect our nuclear waste sites, nor what we are going to say to people in the warnings. What is true is that people are going to ignore them. In Japan there are plenty of 1000 year old tsunami stones which warn people where they should and should not build and, you guessed it, people ignored them.\n\nOne group of people have said the best way ahead is to create a sort of nuclear priesthood and turn the idea of radioactive waste into a cult or religion. That way it will end up as part of a racial memory. Another group, unbelievably, have said the best way ahead is to breed a species of cat which changes colour when they are exposed to radiation. This is not a joke.\n\nEdit https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200731-how-to-build-a-nuclear-warning-for-10000-years-time"}
