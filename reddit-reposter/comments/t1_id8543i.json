According to this, the majority of high-ranking staffers were not only completely unaware that a documentary was being made during the final 6 ~~months~~weeks of Trump's presidency, but also that the idea came from Trump and his family themselves. \n\nKnowing how badly Trump wants to be famous and publicised, and how he's made absolutely brain-dead decisions regarding, well, everything he's ever done, I bet you anything Trump arranged for it all to be kept secret, somehow thinking it'd all be fine if none of those stuck-up staffers found out until after it was over. \n\nRemember, this is the same man who decided to go forward with interviews with Bob Woodward, even after several of his staffers attempted to end interviews, and likely ended up having to do the interviews in secret due to pushback. And he did it anyways because he wants his face to be on every news channel. That's his only goal. \n\nAnyone still supporting him, either by working for him or just generally cheering for his success, genuinely needs to re-evaluate what it is that they value. If it's power with an absolute lack of consideration for the future, of human life, of the planet we live on, of our own differences that make us a beautiful species, then yeah. Trump is the vaguely humanoid creature for that goal, along with his party of child predators called the GOP."}
