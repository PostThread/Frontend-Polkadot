Despite the majority of the procedures/drugs are for free, the Italian people still complain when have to pay a small amount of money (and I mean 10 euros or less) for some of them.\n\n**EDIT:** a lot of people are complaining that's absurd you have to pay a small fraction of the total cost. There are several reasons for this, the most important one is to reduce unnecessary use of health services (that costs a lot). An example? Imagine you are in an hotel. Breakfast is free, so you eat more and more, even if you feel already full. How to reduce this \"over-eating\"? You can ask for a small amount of money for each croissant - not to cover the food cost, but only to push people to thinking about eating more than necessary.  When something is free, it's in the human nature to abuse. It is not a huge problem if you eat more than needed, but health services costs a lot and we can not waste money (and resources) when unnecessary. Remember also that the people who can not afford these little expenses, with chronic diseases (e.g. cancer) or the elderly are completely exempted from any payment."}
