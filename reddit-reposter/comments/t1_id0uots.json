She went into my room and looked into my closet, she didn't really say anything. He was so scared, wanted to break his arm as an excuse as to why he was there. Apparently, she didn't see him and left without saying anything... Now that I'm older, I know that she knew he was there, considering that she probably smelt his cologne. I was raised in a non-confrontational and passive aggressive family \ud83e\udd23 She's never spoke about the situation, maybe she really didn't see him?"}
