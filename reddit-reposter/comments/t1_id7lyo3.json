We were on a back road and I was the only person there. Her car was upside down and I didn\u2019t know what to do, and I was like 100 pounds and couldn\u2019t get her out. I called 911 and stayed with her until they got there but she went unconscious before EMT got there. I\u2019m 38 now and I\u2019m that person that brakes before going through intersections. I didn\u2019t drive for like a year and I still hate driving. I was the last person to talk to her and it haunts me that it also could have been me. There was one other time that had I not looked before going on a green, I would\u2019ve been struck by someone running a red light. Driving is a huge fear. Always check at intersections!!"}
