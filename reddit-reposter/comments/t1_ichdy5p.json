It works with any cylindrical shaped object of similar sizes that are made up of a magnetic material.\n\nBasically, when you shake them, the atoms collide with one another, and this causes the electrons to start flowing in a spiral direction along the length of the nail. The spiral movement of electrons results in a weak magnetic field. When you have a large number of nails as in the video, the magnetic fields align with one another and the nails start bundling up and lining up with one another. It's a pretty cool effect.\n\nOh, and the reason why it's called the S-effect is because it comes from the same place i'm talking out of; my ass."}
