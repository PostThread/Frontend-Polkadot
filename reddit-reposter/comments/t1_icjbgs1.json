My flame point Siamese had hypothyroidism, which needed medication and caused absolutely intense hunger while wasting away at the same time. When he passed away I asked what I do with the medication and all of the nutritional paste I had to feed him, had two unopened bags of pill pockets, huge flat of canned cat food, etc. They refunded EVERYTHING and also suggested I donate (which I did) and sent me a personalized grave plaque for him with a note saying thank you for the pleasure to help support him over the years and gave their sympathies etc. I\u2019ve been using them since they started for a reason."}
