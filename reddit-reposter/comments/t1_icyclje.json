A new park opened up and they wanted to bring in Elephants. They bought a bunch of young ones, figuring the older ones would die sooner. What they ended up with was a bunch of teenage elephants running rampant and flipping over cars and getting into trouble. They couldn\u2019t figure out how to get them to stop until a Ranger suggested bringing in some adults to teach them a lesson. So they brought in some older elephants who quickly put a stop to it because that\u2019s not how to act. So pretty much the same story for any teenagers without adult supervision."}
