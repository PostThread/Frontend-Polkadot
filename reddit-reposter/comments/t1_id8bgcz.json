(He had lost in 1755...) Candidates often engaged in a practice called \u201cswilling the planters with bumbo,\u201d which basically entailed buying voters drinks to get them in a favorable frame of mind before they hit the polls.\n\nJohn Adams started each day by draining a tankard of hard cider. He became a cider devotee as a college student and later saying, \u201cI shall never forget, how refreshing and salubrious we found it, hard as it often was.\u201d\n\nThomas Jefferson grew apples at Monticello, but I digress."}
