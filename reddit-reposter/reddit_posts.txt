Or maybe the other way around, you couldn't hear someone talking because you were concentrating? It's called inattentive deafness, and I used to be able to do that while reading. Long story short, I was teased my family members for 'ignoring' them and trained myself to keep an ear out even when reading a book. Now I can't reach that level of concentration anymore even when I try. And I miss it. Can anyone else relate?\n\nOnce more, this isn't a complaint about modern life/technology ruining my attention span, even though I could complain about that.

The main character is insufferable, a toxic and overly macho sore winner who is written as such an overconfident jackass that I don't feel any sympathy for him when the movie wants me to (I know that's the point of his character, but the script went way too far with it). It has a nice message about valuing teamwork over aggressive individuality, but I just don't get why this movie is such a phenomenon. At best, it seems really unremarkable and padded out.

"books,SiriusNorth_,The Metamorphosis and ill treatment of young men.,Gregor worked himself to the edge of death to keep his family afloat and none of them did a thing to ease his burden even though later it is shown that when push comes to shove they\u2019ll put themselves to work. \n\nDespite Gregor\u2019s favours upon them and his willingness to make sacrifice upon sacrifice for them, once he lost his ability to provide he lost his worth. His family became disgusted by him and allowed him to die alone and rot in his filthy room. \n\nThis story spoke to the sentiment that men are viewed as expendable, even by other men, and that their worth is dependent upon them being protectors and providers. In my opinion there is no problem with expecting men to protect and provide on the condition that if they, through no fault of their own, lose that ability then they should still be loved and cared for by their family and society in general. An example of our failure is that men are sent to fight in wars and once they come home are left to sleep on the streets when they can\u2019t hold down a job due to their trauma. There are of course many who fall on tough times and have a good group of friends and family who are ready to help them through.\n\nWomen also go through their struggles, I wasn\u2019t making a judgment on who has it worse overall, I just thought this was one angle through which to view the story.,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/v4x283/the_metamorphosis_and_ill_treatment_of_young_men/,False"

Due to the fact that I won\u2019t be able to keep her from taking our child to church, I\u2019m asking for ideas and thoughts to help keep this from sort of forcing her to believe.  I told my wife once our kid is old enough to make her own decisions that she can\u2019t force her to go to church if she doesn\u2019t want to.  Some of my family is religious, her family is very religious, so I kinda feel like I\u2019m on my own here to keep her from being sucked into this.

"nosleep,Ok_Bookkeeper_6074,It comes closer whenever I close my eyes,When I was a kid, I used to sleep over at my grandma\u2019s a lot. I was an unexpected baby and my parents weren\u2019t ready to say goodbye to their social life yet, so they dropped me off at my grandmother whenever they made plans with friends. I\u2019d also spend a lot of my daytime at my grandma\u2019s because my parents also worked late. These two things combined made for an arrangement that I\u2019d just stay for my grandma for weeks on end. I didn\u2019t mind, I love my granny very much.\n\nMy grandmother \u2013 Granny Bunny as I liked to call her because of the countless rabbits that\u2019d roam around her garden \u2013 lived in a cute little cottage. A gravel driveway, rose bushes in front of the porch and big pine trees behind her house. The thing that fascinated me most about it was the old well in her garden. Bricks and roof tiles covered with moss and a very old bucket on a rope hanging from the mechanism attached to the roof. It came straight out of a fairytale. She\u2019d tell me stories about it, made up or real, I\u2019m still not sure. She\u2019d say she saw little faeries flying around the well at night (in hindsight the faeries were just fireflies). \n\nOne day I was sitting at the kitchen table, eating the sandwich my granny had just prepared for me. She was reading the paper and telling me about some of the things that were happening in the neighbourhood. Some kid had tried to rob the local supermarket the week prior, and they had just arrested him. \u201cServes him right! Stealing from a local business\u201d, she mumbled as she was shaking her head. I wasn\u2019t paying much attention to what she was saying. I was fascinated by the bunnies in the garden. A brown rabbit was practically begging me to come out and chase it. \u201cGranny, can I go look at the rabbits?\u201d I asked her. She looked up from the paper and nodded. \u201cBut finish your sandwich first!\u201d she said as I was getting ready to get off my chair. I sulked a bit but did what she asked of me. I was almost five years old at the time but I knew better than to disobey my grandmother. \n\nAs soon as I had my little boots on, I sprinted after the bunny that had caught my attention. Of course it didn\u2019t appreciate it and it started bolting away from me. It made its way to the well and disappeared behind it. I followed the bunny but when I reached the other side of the well, the bunny had vanished into thin air. I walked a bit further and looked around in hopes of still being able to spot the bunny. It became clear that the animal had found a safe space to hide from my tiny hands. I pouted and decided I\u2019d just look for another bunny to chase around the garden. When I heard a groan, I turned around, expecting to see my grandma standing by the door to ask me to come back inside, but I was met by something I hadn\u2019t anticipated. Crawling out of the well, I saw a white figure with almost no facial features, just shadows where its eyes and mouth should be. It moved almost as if it were a spider, using its legs way more than a human would. It crouched next to the well and seemed to be staring at me, although I couldn\u2019t be sure because it didn\u2019t have any eyes. I stumbled back in fear. The creature got ready to crawl towards me but when I blinked, it was gone. I kept staring at the spot I\u2019d last seen it in, eyes wide open and a lump in my throat. When I blinked again, it was standing right in front of me, bent over so its face was aligned with mine. I screamed and closed my eyes. \n\n\u201cLola! Lola!\u201d My grandmother came running for me and picked me up. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d I tried telling her what I had seen, but I wasn\u2019t making any sense and she didn\u2019t understand what I was saying. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, baby. Let\u2019s just go back inside.\u201d It\u2019s safe to say I had a horrible night\u2019s sleep that night. I was too scared to close my eyes because that meant the figure could creep into my room without me seeing it move. I only got some sleep after I crawled into my granny\u2019s bed and she put her soft arms around me. Nothing bad could happen when your grandmother was holding you. \n\nAfter that one time, I never saw the figure again. I made sure not to go into the yard alone anymore and would always ask my grandma to come with me when I wanted to chase bunnies. If she was too tired to come outside, I\u2019d just stay inside and sit beside her on the couch, trying to understand what she was reading in the newspaper. Some days passed and the image of the creature vanished from my brain. I was able to sleep again without having to be in Bunny\u2019s bed. Peace had returned, but I spent the rest of my childhood avoiding the well like the plague. \n\nFast forward to a couple of weeks ago. My mother gave me a call and told me that Granny Bunny had passed away. I was defeated by this news and told my mother I\u2019d travel with her to my grandmother\u2019s house to gather some of her stuff and arrange the funeral. The trip to her house was heartbreaking and emotional.\n\nMy mother and I had put all of my grandma\u2019s smaller belongings in boxes. I didn\u2019t know what my mom was going to do with it. Probably donate it to some thrift shop or just throw it out. Maybe she\u2019d keep some of it. I was standing in the living room, holding a picture frame with a photo of my grandma and my grandpa on their honeymoon. I smiled softly and wiped a tear away. I was going to miss my grandma very much. \u201cLola, could you go and see if grandma kept things in the shed?\u201d The sound of my mother\u2019s voice made me look up. \u201cYeah, sure\u201d, I shouted back. She was in my granny\u2019s bedroom, throwing my grandma\u2019s dresses into a box. I put down the frame and went through the door that led to the yard. I had also played in the shed a lot as a kid. It\u2019s where grandma kept the summer activities. An inflatable pool, some chalk, you name it. I forced open the lock that kept the shed closed and entered it. The cobwebs had taken over most of the inside and the dust in the air made me cough. There was barely anything left from the old days. \u201cShe must\u2019ve gotten rid of it when I stopped coming over so much\u201d, I muttered to myself. I left the shed and closed it again behind me. \n\nI brushed some dust of my shirt and turned around so I could go tell my mother that there was nothing noteworthy left in the shed. My heart sunk as I was met by the emotionless face of a white creating staring me down from behind the well. It crawled across the opening of the well. Just like I had done when I was still a little kid, I took a step back and felt my back press against the door of the shed. This time blinking didn\u2019t help and the figure ran towards me on all fours. I made a run for the door and almost made it, but the thing got a hold of my leg and made me trip. I screamed and hit my head pretty hard. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I was actually unconscious or not, but when I opened my eyes again, my mother was crouched next to me, asking me what had happened. When I didn\u2019t reply straight away, she sighed and shook her head. \u201cCan\u2019t trust you with terrain that isn\u2019t flat.\u201d I didn\u2019t disagree. It was easier to make her believe I tripped over my own feet than to make her believe that a faceless, white creature dragged me down. I\u2019m just glad my mother heard me scream, because I don\u2019t know what would have happened if she hadn\u2019t come running. \n\nI won\u2019t bore you with the details of what we did with my grandmother\u2019s belongings, house, or how the funeral went. The only thing that\u2019s important to tell you is that when they were lowering my grandma\u2019s casket into the ground, I blinked a few times to keep tears from streaming down my face and during those blinks, I could see the white figure standing in the darkness of my closed eyelids. It made me shiver, but I shrugged it off. \n\nThe last few days have been rough on me though. I\u2019m single and living alone. The only time I really have a conversation with anyone is at work, and I don\u2019t really feel like talking to my co-workers about the death of my granny, let alone the things I experience when I\u2019m alone at home. The creature hasn\u2019t gone away like it did when I was younger. It doesn\u2019t appear to me the way it did those two times at the well, but I can see him when I close my eyes. At first this was very scary but still somewhat okay, but now it has started to terrify me. He seems to be getting closer. Yes, you read that right. Every time I close my eyes, he seems somewhat closer to my \u2018eyes\u2019 (if you can call it that, he\u2019s standing in the void of my closed eyelids but moves closer). I don\u2019t want to find out what happens when he reaches me. This fear has resulted in me forcing myself to keep my eyes open. I blink as little as possible, but it\u2019s starting to take a toll. My eyes feel incredibly dry and they\u2019re very red. \n\nToday my co-worker asked me what was going on with me. She had noticed that I wasn\u2019t blinking much and told me that a few customers had mentioned it as well, saying it creeped them out how little I blinked. I can\u2019t blame them, I also would be freaked out if some woman was ringing up my items and barely blinked while doing so. It was what my colleague said after that scared me. Severe cases of dry eyes could lead to blindness. I\u2019m the type of person to trust my gut, and my gut was telling me that this was all *very* bad. I blinked, thinking this would magically cure all the dryness that my eyes were experiencing, and I quickly regretted it. The creature was now almost just in front of me, but something had changed about it. It no longer had no facial features at all. Now it had a huge, terrifying grin on his face. \n\nI think it\u2019ll kill me once it reaches me. But I don\u2019t even want to know what happens if I go blind. I fear it\u2019ll turn me into its own kind.,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/v4xgql/it_comes_closer_whenever_i_close_my_eyes/,False"

Daddy Day Care **$104 million** \n9. Dreamgirls **$103 million**\n10. Norbit **$95 million**\n\nEddie Murphy was/is generally known for edgy comedies and Action movies when talking about live action films, the majority of his catalog. However, these lists not only lacks action movies, but even edgy humor, both the worldwide gross and the domestic gross lists **seem rather Family Friendly** overall.\n\nOf course, his two biggest domestic and international hits are action movies, and of course those being his biggest successes likely contribute to the mindset he's an edgy comedian or an action movie star, but a lot of his action movies and edgier films either do good but not great, do horribly, flop, or have cult status. \n\nI for one did not realize that Daddy Day care was as popular as it was, **that's the biggest surprise on both these lists**. Those aren't low numbers, those are massive, especially for the time. I knew the first Doctor Dolittle was popular but did not expect the 2nd one to have been pretty big as well. It seems that Nutty professor and Dolittle share the lions share of gross with the first two cop movies, and while Coming to America is not surprising since it was pretty big back in the day, the Haunted Mansion doing that well worldwide is baffling.\n\nDomestically the haunted mansion is replaced by Dreamgirls which makes sense since it was a very North American centric movie, but these lists really are much more family friendly than expected. Really, Coming to America is the only edgy comedy on the list that you could argue isn't \"family friendly\" but was still viewed by audiences back in the day as a movie familys can enjoy. If anything only Beverly Hills Cop 1 and 2, were clearly not targeting kids, however kids went to see the movie, parents brought them along, they snuck into theaters, and many teenagers also saw it, this is along with adults, but it's the only one that was really \"out\" of the family friendly zone.\n\nMan, when they couldn't get Eddie Murphy to be in Dolittle 3 people must have been mad.\n\n**Also fun fact, Eddie Murphy was offered the role in Ghostbusters but turned it down to do Beverly Hills Cop.** Turned out to be a good decision because it beat Ghostbusters worldwide and Domestically that year, despite GhostBusters having more buzz talk, merch marketing, and a more widely spread theme song (kids and teens were often talking about R rated films at skool or the mall outside of Rambo style stuff), though Axels theme was also pretty big at the time. BHC sequel also demolished Ghost Busters II, so it was a good long term decision as well. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut for fun let's look at the action movie grosses as well:\n\n# Action Movie List Worldwide:\n\n1. Beverly Hills Cop **$316 million**\n2. Beverly Hills Cop 2 **$276 million**\n3. Another 48 Hrs. **$152 million** \n4. Tower Heist **$150 million**\n5. Beverly Hills Cop 3 **$119 million**\n6. Golden Child **$79 million**\n7. Showtime **$78 million**\n8. 48 Hrs. **$75 million**\n9. I-Spy **$60 million**\n\n# Action Movies Domestic:\n\n1. Beverly Hills Cop **$234 million**\n2. Beverly Hills Cop 2 **$153 million**\n3. Another 48 Hrs. **$80 million** \n4. The Golden Child **$79 million**\n5. Tower Heist **$78 million**\n6. 48 Hrs. **$75 million**\n7. Beverly Hills Cop 3 **$42 million**\n8. Showtime **$37 million**\n9. I-Spy **$33 million**\n10. Metro **$32 million**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo just like in general for Eddies career Beverly Hills cop 1 and 2 are his most successful action movies, not surprising since they are also his most successful movies of all time for live action. If you include animated it's all 4 Shreks that are his most successful films, Beverly Hills Cop does beat Mulan though and scores 5th highest. \n\nOne thing about these lists is that I didn't realize how huge Another 48 Hrs was. $152 million internationally puts it right below the Haunted mansion. ***It's a shame we may never see the full uncut version of that film*** because it was the last one to embody 80's Eddie Murphy and Nick Nolte releasing right on 1990.\n\n***But another big thing I've noticed is Tower Heist***, when it was relevant there was a constant talk about it reinvigorating Eddies career if they played it right, as the 2010's were not the best of times, along with the late 2000's for Murphy. People were saying that he was back, and if they followed it up he would be a big star again. However, people have blamed the next movie, A thousand words, which flopped harder with critics than any movie Eddie has done, literally, for ruining that.\n\nOriginally I somewhat agreed with them, however I did feel there was a little bit of exaggerating in that claim. But now looking at how well that movie actually did, and how badly A thousand words did, I have to say they were all right.\n\nDomestically, Tower Heist was the biggest action film for murphy since the Golden Child, and internationally since Another 48 hrs. so I agree that A thousand words basically killed Eddies career revival.\n\nHowever, he seems to be picking up recently, Coming 2 America did ok, though it was the modern equal to being released straight to video, but fans of the original MOSTLY seem to like the movie adn Amazon with no numbers claims it's a huge success. Eddie has promised Beverly Hills Cop IV would film after it and it seems to be happening after countless delays for years.\n\nThe question is, can Eddie pull off even a BHCII with Beverly Hills Cop IV in quality? Can he revive his action movie career with a bang? He's getting a bit old there, who knows what can happen. \n\nOnly issue I have though is apparently that film is associated with Netflix, if Netflix allows a theatrical version of Beverly Hills Cop 4 it'd be great, but if it's only Netflix that would be kind of irritating. With how easy it is for even bad movies to gross these days a good BHC4 would send Eddie to past earths atmosphere.,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/v4xhh9/eddie_murphys_top_10_highest_grossing_live_movies/,False"

Something similar to Discogs that records every version of a particular release. Like for example, if I looked up \"Knives Out\" I would see the DVD releases as well as the Blu-Ray releases, and maybe even some notes about what extra's each disc contain and maybe the video resolution.\n\nI know there is [Blur-ray.com](https://Blur-ray.com), but that site is a bit janky, and hard to use to look up releases, especially if a movie had never been released on Blu-ray, it's decent for collectors, but a bit hard to use for researchers.\n\nDoes a website like I'm describing exist? If not, how could I go about working to create one? What skills would I need to make something like I'm describing?\n\nThanks in advance!,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/v4xiob/physical_release_database/,False"

"tifu,Desperate-Dust5334,TIFU by telling my coworker it's beef juice,Long time lurker, first post, obligatory happened two years ago\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've been serving at this place currently for about five years, but at the point that this story began, I was there for three. Reason why it matters is because of the fact that I am considered a senior employee as a result of my tenure. New guy recently got bumped up to being a server, and has a lot of questions. We all help each other out, and he was comfortable with me so he'd often ask me questions about how to ring something in or whatever. Let's call him C. C has a pretty confident personality, so I liked him, but he would always be doing crazy stuff, like flicking the lights on and off of the family bathroom to fuck with people. \n\nSo it's a Sunday afternoon, pretty weeded. Again, I was considered a senior employee, so they trusted me with having more tables than just the regular 3 table section. This particular morning I had about six tables at the current moment I'll describe. I'm at the POS, and I'm ringing in an order for one of the six tables, obviously I'm weeded. R pulls up to the computer next to me, and asks me a question about one of the entrees that we have. \n\nImagine a circle, one half is your choice of mashed potatoes or rice, and the other half is chopped steak, onions and mushrooms, with BROWN GRAVY. The gravy comes with it. This is the entree.\n\nC's question was, \"Does this come with brown gravy? This lady said she doesn't want it.\"\n\nI looked at his computer screen, and saw that it was under the screen where you could edit the mashed potatoes, add cheese, bacon, gravy, whatever. So me being weeded and not listening, I assumed he was asking if the mashed potatoes come with brown gravy, to which I said\n\n\"No.\"\n\nR: \"Are you sure? This lady specifically said she doesn't want brown gravy.\"\n\nMe: \\*keep in mind I'm weeded\\* \"I'm pretty sure it doesn't, but if you're not sure, type in no brown gravy.\"\n\nR: \"Nah, I trust you.\" \\*orders the food\\*\n\nTwenty minutes later, food comes out and it's clear as day there's fucking brown gravy on it. I'm no longer weeded, but I happened to be in the back when it came out. C walks up to me with the plate,\n\nC: \"Are you sure this isn't brown gravy?\"\n\nFuck. Now I'm in a position where I've been here too long to be fucking up, part of me doesn't wanna own up to it. C's looking like he doesn't really wanna deal with it either. \n\nMe: \"Um.. You know what? Just tell her it's beef juice.\"- (Honestly, I said this as a joke.)\n\nRemember how I said C was confident?  \n\n\nC: \"Are you serious?\"\n\nMe: \"I mean,-\"\n\nC: \"Fuck it.\"\n\nSo, at that point, it was out of my hands. Dude takes it to the table, and I actually walk behind him to see what happens out of curiosity, as if this brown gravy on this plate will pass off as beef juice. I watch C hand out the food- it's both him and my coworker passing it out. My other coworker puts the said entree in front of the lady, and honestly, the funniest fucking part was the expression on her face. Her eyebrows were scrunched so lightly, as if she was balancing a needle between them both, and her mouth was finding the right muscles to say-\n\nLady: \"This looks like brown gravy.\"\n\nC: (point's at her plate, where the obvious brown gravy lies,) \"No ma'am, that's beef juice.\"\n\nLady said nothing, but her eyebrows were now throughly scrunched. \n\nTwo weeks later, we all find out she left a review.  [https://imgur.com/gallery/eLXj2q1](https://imgur.com/gallery/eLXj2q1)\n\nTurns out C actually took care of this lady before, and fucked up the gravy the first time, and now, the second time when he brought the food over, he just straight up called it beef juice.\n\nHe's a legend now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\ntldr; I told my coworker brown gravy is 'beef juice' on an entree, and the lady wrote a hilarious review.,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/v4xj8z/tifu_by_telling_my_coworker_its_beef_juice/,False"

"nosleep,unclear_definition,Night shift- Cherry [remake],\nLog 1 - Jack\n  Hello you can call me jack, I work at a gas station. I\u2019ve been working for about a year and I\u2019ve seen some pretty weird things. I talked to the day shift guy and he told me about this sub and that some of you might believe me. \n\nLog 2 - The manager\u2019s list \n When I first started working here my manager gave me a list for if a man with red hair came to visit. when he explained that I had to follow the list perfectly, the look on his face scared me. This 40 something year old biker looked to have one of the most horrified looks I\u2019d ever seen on a human face. It was like he could die from just upsetting this man in the slightest. I will type out what the list says here\u2026\n\n1- If you see a man with red hair and a lollipop please follow all instructions on this list. You may call him Cherry.\n\n2-Cherry is aloud to smoke inside. Please don\u2019t try to stop him.\n\n3- When Cherry arrives he will ask for two packs of cigarettes. Please give him the two black cigarette boxes on the very bottom shelf. Do not give these packs to anyone besides Cherry.\n\n4- There should be a box under the counter. After you have gotten the two packs of cigarettes put both the box and the cigarettes on the counter. \n\n5- After you put the box and cigarettes on the counter Cherry will tell you to put it on the manager\u2019s tab. Though I do not have a tab you will tell him ok.\n\n6- After Cherry has collected all items off the counter he will walk to the back and sit at my desk. Please do not stop him and please do not try to go into the back with him.\n\n7- after some time Cherry will come back out without the box. Don\u2019t ask where the box went or what was in the box.\n\n8- Cherry is aloud to sit on the counter at anytime before or after you give him the box.\n\n\nLog 3 - man of red \n When my manager first gave me the list I thought Either he was crazy or I was going mad. But sure enough on my first night shift a man with bright red hair walked in chewing a lollipop. There wasn\u2019t really anything off about the way he looked so I just assumed my manager just got caught up in a gang or something. But there was one thing, The man that stood on the other side of the counter was tall and well built. But his hair was a sickening bright red, The kind of red people use when warning of something. Think of a stop sign or a red light but much, much brighter. A disgustingly Neon red that made everything else around him seem dull and colorless in comparison. This had to be the Cherry my manager was talking about in his list.\n\nI scrambled to the frigid tile floor frantically looking for the packs of cigarettes the manager mentioned. And there on the bottom shelf, two completely black cigarette boxes sit. I was surprised at first because we don\u2019t keep anything on the bottom shelf, so it accumulates dust easily. But on this dusty bottom shelf were two perfectly pristine black boxes, no scuffs or dents in the cardboard not even the smallest amount of dust. I grab them and stood up violently making myself dizzy, but my next priority was the box under the counter. I crouch down looking at the small shelf were we keep random items and the store phone. And there just like the cigarettes, sits an almost Disgustingly perfect box with nothing signifying it had ever been handled. I put both the cigarettes and box on the counter waiting for a response from this man.\n\nHe looks at the counter and then at me. \n\u201cManager\u2019s tab\u201d he said in a surprisingly soft voice, the kind of voice you might here from an old storyteller. He grabs his items and walks into to the back shutting the large metal door behind him. I was surprised because even the manager couldn\u2019t budge that old heavy door, but this man just closed it using one hand. In a little bit of shock I stand at the counter waiting for this mystery man to come back out. The thing is most people don\u2019t really come during the graveyard shifts unless it\u2019s for gas or a midnight snack, so all I had to do was wait.\n\nLog 4 - missing box\n\nI don\u2019t know how long I stood there if I\u2019m being honest, it\u2019s just one moment I\u2019m standing there and the next The man called Cherry walked out. The light screeching of the door being push open is what snapped me out of the trance. He walks out looking no different from when he first arrived, and he just leaves. The door rings as the man of red steps into to night, large droplets hitting his body. Windows vibrating with the heavy rain, the red of his hair like a spotlight in the gloom.\nHe slowly disappeared, I remember the manager\u2019s list said he wouldn\u2019t have the box and it was right. The small box I had given him when he arrived was no longer in his possession. Shaking slightly I step though into the back, but there\u2019s nothing and I don\u2019t mean like nothing important I\u2019m saying there was literally nothing. The manager\u2019s desk and chair in the corner of the room as always and the trash bin empty. Nothing changed or moved it looked cleaner if I\u2019m being truthful, it looked like the guy just scrubbed the entirety of the room with industrial cleaning fluid. It didn\u2019t make sense but I noticed I couldn\u2019t smell anything, nothing at all. No cleaning chemicals no dusty musk nothing! I walked back out of the room just to make sure I didn\u2019t loose my sense of smell, but that wasn\u2019t it.  It was like he erased any proof that he was ever there, no smell, no taste in the air, nothing was there showing that Cherry had ever shown up instead of the absence of him. \n\nI stand back at the counter questioning if he really did ever show up. Am I going crazy!? The silence of the shop not giving me any comfort, the rain beating heavy on the thin windows. \n\nAfter working here for so long you get used to the unusual customers, the weird one\u2019s like Cherry or the unspeakable horrors that come to get a late night drink. Again my names Jack and at the gas station I work We get some pretty strange customers.\n\nEnd logs,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/v4xp2y/night_shift_cherry_remake/,False"

"atheism,Elbrujosalvaje,NEWSFLASH: Just because atheists and agnostics reject your religion as absurd, laughable and even downright cancerous does not make them \"intolerant\" and \"narrow-minded.\" Who else is sick and tired of religious fools always thinking like this?,A lot of religious people have language difficulties, particularly problems with definitions. They seem to think you have to be gullible or believe in some kind of moral and cultural relativism to be considered tolerant and open-minded. So let's go over the meaning of a few words. \n\nAccording to the *Cambridge English Dictionary*, the word *tolerance* is defined as the:\n \n>\"willingness to accept behaviour and beliefs that are different from your own, although you might not agree with or approve of them.\" \n\nThe word *intolerance* is defined as:\n\n>\"the fact of refusing to accept ideas, beliefs, or behaviour that are different from your own.\"\n\nJust because someone thinks your religion is stupid or wrong or that you're an idiot for believing in it does not make that person \"intolerant.\" Examples of intolerance are banning all Christians and Muslims from grocery stores and movie theaters, censoring religious beliefs from books and magazines or burning down some Christian's house because you think their religious beliefs are childish and absurd. In a nutshell, intolerance involves censorship of religious beliefs and/or discrimination against religious people because you refuse to accept them as equal members of your neighborhood, community or nation. This *may* lead to total exclusion and expulsion from society, such as what happened to the Jews at various times in history, and even armed conflict, like what happened during the Crusades and the European Wars of Religion. \n\nSo while someone may think Christians are a bunch of religious clowns and bible-thumping dimwits for believing in their primitive Bronze Age beliefs, they aren't being intolerant, unless they want to see Christians forced to wear badges to identify themselves in public. Just because the non-religious \"accept\" (in the sense of \"allow\") religious beliefs does not mean they agree with them or believe everything is relative or some nonsense like that, rather what it does mean is they won't round up every Koran they can get their hands on and burn it or deport all Muslims.\n\nReligious people are also fond of using words like \"open-minded\" and \"narrow-minded.\" According to the *Cambridge English Dictionary*, the word *open-minded* is defined as:\n\n>\"willing to consider ideas and opinions that are new or different to your own.\"\n\nThe word *narrow-minded* is defined as:\n\n>\"not willing to accept ideas or ways of behaving that are different from your own.\"\n\nJust being willing to consider new ideas is enough to make someone open-minded. Most atheists have looked into religions like Christianity, Islam and Judaism, examined all of the \"evidence\" they have to offer, but ended up rejecting all of them as seriously deficient because they turned out to be false. That doesn't make them narrow-minded, that makes them open-minded. They would consider these religions again if newer and better evidence were to be made available. Since none has been forthcoming, they continue as atheists. If anything, it's Christians who are narrow-minded because they won't even look at the mass of evidence showing how wrong they are, otherwise they wouldn't be Christians.,https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/v4xpmy/newsflash_just_because_atheists_and_agnostics/,False"

"TwoXChromosomes,whygodmewhyplease,I'm so frustrated with this IUD pain,I had the copper IUD inserted last month, and it was horrible. Probably the worst pain in my life, and I passed out. \n\nIt hurt severely for two weeks after, and just recently had started to get better to where I can be up and around again, finally. \n\nWell last night I noticed a throbbing pain in my right side, and felt like I may have just pushed myself with too much activity. I figured after a good night's rest, it would feel better in the morning. Kind of like a bad bruise or something, right?\n\nNo, I woke up in excruciating agony today. It straight up feels like I am being shanked in the right ovary. It comes in intermittent waves. It's the worst when I'm laying down, which sucks because I'm exhausted from the pain and want nothing more than to crawl into bed, seethe, and sleep. My liver is probably going to fail from the amount of ibuprofen I'm abusing. \n\nAnd when the pain starts a new wave, I get that same feeling I did when it was inserted. My blood pressure drops, I get very hot and sweaty, and I immediately want to throw up. I did so in the shower just 15 minutes ago.\n\nI haven't really bled from it since insertion. A little spotting, but not even enough to be red, y'know? I don't think it has perforated anything, but I think it has moved and is pressing on some painful area. \n\nI'm scheduled for my follow up with the GYN on the 13th. I don't know if I can make it that long. Since it's Saturday, I'm stuck waiting both today and tomorrow before I can call and pray they get me in sooner. \n\nI'd go to the ER for immediate removal, but I'm so scared I can't afford it. I've already had to deal with massive medical bills from a separate ER visit, I can't go through that stress again. \n\nI'm just. So frustrated. This was my last available option out of an assortment of birth control I've tried. I needed it to be perfect.\n\nThank you for anyone listening to me rant.,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/v4xqps/im_so_frustrated_with_this_iud_pain/,False"

"TwoXChromosomes,AdRude9789,Female clothes for men?,I (m28) relatively recently realized that I identify more as gender fluid than as just male. I have always been interested in feminine clothes, such as skirts, dresses, jumpsuits, rompers, etc, but I haven't ever really done much with it until now. I want to start trying some of those clothes, but the few times that I've tried skirts or dresses I feel like they don't quite fit me right since they were designed for a women's body, not a man's. \n\nAny advice on how to find female/feminine clothing that can fit a male body fairly well too?

Its foolish to expect a child's artwork to be on-par with that of an adults.

"television,Dull_Significance687,Television After 9/11: A Continuing Series... Homeland, the Anti-Heroine, and the New Look at How We Fight The War on Terror (Showtime | Seasons 1, 2, 3), \n\nMany critics and viewers looked at *Homeland* pretty much from beginning to end as Howard Gordon and Alex Gansa \u2014 the series\u2019 showrunners who had been at the center of *24* and recruited many of that series writers \u2014 as an apologia for every Jack Bauer and CTU had done during the past decade. Gordon and Gansa fervently denied it and I can understand why because pretty much from the beginning it was clear that the series had completely different approaches and attitudes. *24* was basically an expanded action series; *Homeland* was essentially a thriller. *24* did everything in service of immediate action; *Homeland* was all about the long game. The characters on *24* saw things almost entirely in black and white; *Homeland* was entirely about the grey areas. And never was this clearer then with their choice of lead character.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to consider Carrie Matheson, who would be magnificently be played by Claire Danes for eight seasons, the first real example of what I and other critics have called the \u2018anti-heroine\u2019 This is an exaggeration. I\u2019ve already made it clear that *Damages* featured the struggle between two such characters, and simultaneously TNT developed the series *Saving Grace,* a show centered on an Oklahoma City detective (one of Holly Hunter\u2019s greatest performances) with much of the same flawed moral compass and hard living behavior that Carrie Matheson would demonstrate a few years later. Nor were even these characters the first examples \u2014 Showtime would develop a series of dramedies featuring female characters whose behavior ranked from hard-to-handle (*United States of Tara, The Big C*) to downright criminal (*Weeds, Nurse Jackie*). And the critics and audiences were favorable to most of them \u2014 Glenn Close and Holly Hunter would dominate the Best Actress Emmy nominations with Close winning two awards, and all four Showtime series would earn multiple nominations for the lead actresses (Toni Collette, Edie Falco and Laura Linney would end up each winning a Golden Globe and an Emmy for their work in their series, while Mary-Louise Parker would end up taking a Golden Globe for *Weeds*) What makes Carrie the most radical of the bunch is that pretty much from the beginning of *Homeland* to its end is that she is willing to do whatever takes to get what she wants, no matter how much of an outcast it makes her among her peers.\n\nCarrie is convinced in the beginning of Season 1 that Nick Brody (Damian Lewis) an American prisoner of war retrieved in Afghanistan is working for a terrorist leader named Abu Nazir. She almost immediately begins an illegal surveillance of him, despite the open hostility all of her higher-ups at the CIA believe. The only person who supports her is her mentor Saul Berenson (Mandy Patinkin) and even he doesn\u2019t believe in what she is doing much of the first season. For most of the season we have every reason to think Carrie doesn\u2019t know what the hell she\u2019s doing and for good reason: Carrie is a hard drinking, sexually promiscuous woman who has already ruined her immediate superior\u2019s marriage by having an affair with him. There\u2019s also the fact that she\u2019s bipolar and is very reluctant to take her medication \u2014 a fact she has gone to great trouble to keep the Agency unaware of.\n\nHer obsession with Brody becomes more and more reckless as the season unfolds eventually lead to her having encounters with Brody, which finally becomes a full on affair of love. The writers are very smart and don\u2019t tip to their hand for more than half the season \u2014 Brody\u2019s erratic behavior can be explained by his trauma and trying to fit into a world that has painfully moved on without him. His wife has been having an affair with his best friend for the past three years (they\u2019re actually in a middle of a tryst when she finds out he has been rescued), his children are strangers to him (indeed, the son barely remembers him) and while he denies knowing Abu Nazir and what happened to a fellow prisoner Tom Walker, we know he\u2019s lying \u2014 because we saw that he beat Tom to death in the Pilot. Brody can\u2019t connect with the real world and finds it easier to connect with Carrie (and Dana).\n\n This leads to what I consider *Homeland\u2019s* greatest moment: \u2018The Weekend\u2019 (I ranked it as one of the fifty greatest episodes of the new millennium a few years back). Carrie and Brody are off the grid in a cabin, in the glow of a love and sexual affair, and Carrie reveals inadvertently about the surveillance. Brody is incredulous, especially when he learns that it is *Carrie,* not the government that thinks he working for Al-Qaida. They detail every one of his ticks and he seems to have a plausible answer for all of them. But it ends with Carrie no more satisfied than the viewer \u2014 until there\u2019s one more revelation.\n\nThis actually leads me to the character I actually found far more intriguing. Saul is the most jaded character who knows everything and who no one seems willing to listen to, neither his superiors nor his inferiors. But it\u2019s clear from the beginning he\u2019s the wisest member of the cast, and the series\u2019 greatest decision was to make the crux of the series the relationship between Saul and Carrie.\n\nWhile Carrie and Brody are having their encounter, Eileen Faisel, an American woman who was radicalized and is central to the plot is captured trying to escape. Saul persuades his boss to go down to Texas to pick her up and question her. Deliberately he chooses to drive which he knows will take nearly two days. He spend much of the next episode trying to establish a rapport with Eileen, not interrogating her, not even asking her question, just talking. Halfway through the trip, he stops at a school in Ohio where he group \u2014 where he was raised an Orthodox Jew and couldn\u2019t even acknowledge his fellow student or play ball. He mentions his marriage to an Indian woman, which is clearly on the verge of collapse. At this point Eileen \u2014 who has said barely two words \u2014 asks him about his marriage. Saul is honest with her. Finally, he asked her what her radicalization is about: \u201cIf this is geopolitical, if this is religious, I can\u2019t help you\u2026But if this about a girl who fell in love with a man with dark skin, maybe I understand.\u201d\n\nIn the next scene, Saul calls his boss with the simple statement: \u201cWe have a deal in place.\u201d Saul, in essence has cracked the plot, and revealed that an American prisoner of war *was* turned \u2014 Tom Walker, the man believed dead. In what will become a standard for him, he somehow manages to arrange things so that Carrie gets the credit for it.\n\nIn *Homeland\u2019*s first season, the show would win Emmys in every major category, including Best Actor and Actress for Lewis and Danes respectively. Yet though Patinkin would receive five nominations for his work on *Homeland* he would never win an Emmy. Considering *Homeland*\u2019s overall record with the Emmys and the fact that Patinkin had won years earlier for his brilliant work on *Chicago Hope,* it may be a bit touchy of me to still be a little pissed by this. But for this episode at least, Patinkin certainly deserved a prize.\n\nAs for the Brody storyline as a whole, perhaps it would have been better for the show had the writers decided *not* to make Brody a terrorist as well. That said they did a superb job showing the level of manipulation that everybody was always putting him through. Abu Nazir and his followers were trying to use Brody for their own ends, but the show made it perfectly clear that everybody in the government \u2014 from the powerbrokers to the Vice President (a man whose career and behavior was clearly modeled on George H.W. Bush) was using him for the exact same things. And in what was the clearest example of this, the series made it clear that Nazir had become more amplified in his attacks on America after one that killed his son as will as innocent civilians\u2026 an attack the Vice President had advertised as being a model strike for the War on Terror. It was a bit heavy-handed, but I don\u2019t know any other series that would have bothered to try and make the point at all.\n\nWhile I thought the second season was far better than many critics thought, I will acknowledge there were way too many heavy handed moments. Most of them involved Dana, Nick\u2019s teenage daughter in storylines that made it seem that not only had Gordon and Gansa learned nothing from Kim Bauer, but were doubling down on the worst aspects of Day 2. And the plot which ended up with Walden being killed was pretty ludicrous. But the larger storyline \u2014 that Brody was serving so many masters that he was no longer sure he could handle it \u2014 was still very powerful. And the overarching plot of Walden trying to use Brody for his own political gains much the same way as Abu Nazir was was particularly intriguing.\n\n Still, I think it's safe to say that all *Homeland* fans were relieved when Brody was *dropped* at the end of Season 3. Thanks to the decision to end this arc, the show was able to go in directions that no one would\u2019ve thought possible, certainly not me. In order to explain these arcs and why they worked so well, in the next article I will discuss the two characters who, with the exception of Carrie and Saul, lasted the longest on *Homeland* and what their characters brought to the stories that would follow.,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/v4xscu/television_after_911_a_continuing_series_homeland/,False"

"tifu,VanCortez,TIFU by making my toddler chip her teeth,This actually happened today. \n\nMy daughter is now 13 months old, and a very sweet but a also bit crazy child. \n\nRecently she started to just lay her head on the ground for no reason. Like forehead first, a lot of the times smiling while doing it. It looks as ridiculous as you can imagine. \n\nSo today I tried to make her laugh by imitating her. I put my forehead on the floor, then slowly lift it up, grinning like a maniac. She loved it and started to laugh hysterically. So here comes the fuck up. She found it so funny that she wanted to play with me by also putting her head on the ground. There were two problems.\n \n1. She was sitting on tiles. \n2. She decided to smack her head full force on the ground, instead of slowly lowering it like always. I think she was too hyped up from laughing. \n\nSo after she tried to kill the ground with a headbutt, all hell broke loose. You know when kids charge a scream? She was charging like son goku was charging his spirit bomb. It went over multiple episodes in our apartment. My wife quickly picked her up and just said, in panic: it broke off!!! And in my mind I was already imagining that all of her milk teeth were gone, while blood was pouring everywhere. So after my daughter got some breast to calm down, we checked. It was a very small part of one of her upper front teeth missing. Like if someone pressed a fingernail against it. So small we couldn't even find it on the floor. After 10 minutes she was back to normal and we decided that we will have it checked out at the dentist next week, because as my wife said \"it feels like giving breast to a piranha\".\n\nSo in the future, I have to account for kids doing things that are maybe not as expected or reasonable as it would be from a grown up and not get them any funny ideas while sitting on tiles. \n\nTL;DR played with my daughter, she smacked her head on the ground because she got too excited.

"nosleep,unclear_definition,Night shift - Cherry - remake,Log 1 - Jack\n  Hello you can call me jack, I work at a gas station. I\u2019ve been working for about a year and I\u2019ve seen some pretty weird things. I talked to the day shift guy and he told me about this sub and that some of you might believe me. \n\nLog 2 - The manager\u2019s list \n When I first started working here my manager gave me a list for if a man with red hair came to visit. when he explained that I had to follow the list perfectly, the look on his face scared me. This 40 something year old biker looked to have one of the most horrified looks I\u2019d ever seen on a human face. It was like he could die from just upsetting this man in the slightest. I will type out what the list says here\u2026\n\n1- If you see a man with red hair and a lollipop please follow all instructions on this list. You may call him Cherry.\n\n2-Cherry is aloud to smoke inside. Please don\u2019t try to stop him.\n\n3- When Cherry arrives he will ask for two packs of cigarettes. Please give him the two black cigarette boxes on the very bottom shelf. Do not give these packs to anyone besides Cherry.\n\n4- There should be a box under the counter. After you have gotten the two packs of cigarettes put both the box and the cigarettes on the counter. \n\n5- After you put the box and cigarettes on the counter Cherry will tell you to put it on the manager\u2019s tab. Though I do not have a tab you will tell him ok.\n\n6- After Cherry has collected all items off the counter he will walk to the back and sit at my desk. Please do not stop him and please do not try to go into the back with him.\n\n7- after some time Cherry will come back out without the box. Don\u2019t ask where the box went or what was in the box.\n\n8- Cherry is aloud to sit on the counter at anytime before or after you give him the box.\n\n\nLog 3 - man of red \n When my manager first gave me the list I thought Either he was crazy or I was going mad. But sure enough on my first night shift a man with bright red hair walked in chewing a lollipop. There wasn\u2019t really anything off about the way he looked so I just assumed my manager just got caught up in a gang or something. But there was one thing, The man that stood on the other side of the counter was tall and well built. But his hair was a sickening bright red, The kind of red people use when warning of something. Think of a stop sign or a red light but much, much brighter. A disgustingly Neon red that made everything else around him seem dull and colorless in comparison. This had to be the Cherry my manager was talking about in his list.\n\nI scrambled to the frigid tile floor frantically looking for the packs of cigarettes the manager mentioned. And there on the bottom shelf, two completely black cigarette boxes sit. I was surprised at first because we don\u2019t keep anything on the bottom shelf, so it accumulates dust easily. But on this dusty bottom shelf were two perfectly pristine black boxes, no scuffs or dents in the cardboard not even the smallest amount of dust. I grab them and stand up violently making myself dizzy, but I had to get the box under the counter. I crouch down looking at the small shelf were we keep random items and the only store phone. And there just like the cigarettes, sits an almost Disgustingly perfect box with nothing signifying it had ever been handled. I put both the cigarettes and box on the counter waiting for a response from this man.\n\nHe looks at the counter and then at me. \n\u201cManager\u2019s tab\u201d he said in a surprisingly soft voice, the kind of voice you might here from an old storyteller. He grabs his items and walks into to the back shutting the large metal door behind him. I was surprised because even the manager couldn\u2019t budge that old heavy door, but this man just closed it using one hand. In a little bit of shock I stand at the counter waiting for this mystery man to come back out. The thing is most people don\u2019t really come during the graveyard shifts unless it\u2019s for gas or a midnight snack, so all I had to do was wait.\n\nLog 4 - missing box\n\nI don\u2019t know how long I stood there if I\u2019m being honest, it\u2019s just one moment I\u2019m standing there and the next The man called Cherry walked out. The light screeching of the door being push open is what snapped me out of the trance. He walks out looking no different from when he first arrived, and he just leaves. The door rings as the man of red steps into to night, large droplets hitting his body. Windows vibrating with the heavy rain, the red of his hair like a spotlight in the gloom.\nHe slowly disappeared, I remember the manager\u2019s list said he wouldn\u2019t have the box and it was right. The small box I had given him when he arrived was no longer in his possession. Shaking slightly I step though into the back, but there\u2019s nothing and I don\u2019t mean like nothing important I\u2019m saying there was literally nothing. The manager\u2019s desk and chair in the corner of the room as always and the trash bin empty. Nothing changed or moved it looked cleaner if I\u2019m being truthful, it looked like the guy just scrubbed the entirety of the room with industrial cleaning fluid. It didn\u2019t make sense but I noticed I couldn\u2019t smell anything, nothing at all. No cleaning chemicals no dusty musk nothing! I walked back out of the room just to make sure I didn\u2019t loose my sense of smell, but that wasn\u2019t it.  It was like he erased any proof that he was ever there, no smell, no taste in the air, nothing was there showing that Cherry had ever shown up instead of the absence of him. \n\nI stand back at the counter questioning if he really did ever show up. Am I going crazy!? The silence of the shop not giving me any comfort, the rain beating heavy on the thin windows. \n\nAfter working here for so long you get used to the unusual customers, the weird one\u2019s like Cherry or the unspeakable horrors that come to get a late night drink. Again my names Jack and at the gas station I work We get some pretty strange customers.\n\nEnd logs,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/v4xxmi/night_shift_cherry_remake/,False"

Both have the same liquidity. \n\nAm I missing something? What is the point of these funds and why would I use them to save for short-term financial goals?

"tifu,Abre-San,tifu thinking I locked the door at work,So today at work I(26M) fucked up. To start I should explain that at work I am known to frequent the bathroom as I suffer from stomach problems, so normally when I need to go I REALLY gotta go. Things have been getting better thanks to dietary changes, but today was an instance where I REALLY needed to go. I also won't say exactly where I work, but I am a supervisor at my job and we work with coffee so that doesn't help with bowel movements. \n\nI was working with another one of our supervisors today who is one of the sweetest people that works there. She is very quiet and kind, so when she does talk to you it feels like an honor. Whenever we catch her laughing about something one of us said at work it feels really good just because of how calm she presents herself at work.\n\nTo the fuck up. I was letting the people I worked with I was going to have to step off of the floor to use the restroom, and as usual everyone was fine with it. I rush to the bathroom and take my apron off and put it on the hanger on the door and lock the door. I fight with these intestinal demons for a few minutes before it starts to settle down. I was getting ready to finish my business when I hear a knock at the door. I get nervous when I'm using a public restroom and someone knocks, so I do not say anything as I assumed the door was locked. This is where I realized I fucked up.\n\nI hear the door start to open and my head shoots up to see the coworker in question standing there. She immediately begins to apologize and shuts the door. I am overcome with shame and my heart starts pounding because I feel AWFUL for what has just happened. I did lock the door as soon as I realized what happened and finished my business. \n\nOnce I was out I apologized to her many times and thankfully she was understanding. We had a laugh about it as she is the same way and doesn't respond to knocks. I just feel awful that this lovely human being just witnessed me with my pants around my ankles while working the chocolate factory. \n\ntl;dr: went to use the restroom at work and forgot to lock the door and one of my nicest possible coworkers walked in on me.,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/v4y1mp/tifu_thinking_i_locked_the_door_at_work/,False"
"TwoXChromosomes,IAreAEngineer,Feminism, Traditional Roles and Choice,I was chatting the other day with an older man. I'm the tail end of the baby boom, he's probably the oldest of the boomers, or possibly the generation before.\n\nWe were commiserating about being widowed.  He decided he didn't want to be alone anymore, and so he found someone and they're engaged.  So far, so good.  But then he mentioned she's a recent immigrant from a country where feminism hasn't taken over, and that was a large part of what he wanted in a wife.\n\nI wondered what he meant by feminism, I didn't challenge him on that.  I think he wants a wife like he had, someone who cooks, cleans, manages all the details like grandkids birthdays, etc.\n\nAnd there's nothing wrong with that, if both agree.  I am definitely a feminist.  When our kids were young, my husband and I looked at the finances, and we decided that I could stay home with them.\n\nIt was a mutual decision, not one my husband expected or imposed on me. So I think of feminism as men and women having an equal say in the decisions, regardless of who has the bigger income.\n\nI just wonder, what are all these negative impressions some men have of feminism?  I guess they're used to calling all the shots, maybe their relationship with their wives is more employer/employee than equal partners?,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/v4x9bu/feminism_traditional_roles_and_choice/,False"

"tifu,laskothrowaway,TIFU by assuming my boyfriend of 2 years was Chinese when he was Vietnamese.,I think this needs to be clarified before going into how this came to be. No our relationship didn't change and its a funny moment. This TIFU really came to be because neither of us put that much importance to our ethnic background. \n\nMy boyfriend's last name is Ho. Ho is used in both Vietnamese and Chinese. This is the beginning of the mistaken assumption I made. Me and him are Asian-American so we lost a lot of the nuances where the minor differences between Vietnamese and Chinese would show. When we would go to Vietnamese restaurants he'd generally order in English. Sometimes he'd order in \"Vietnamese\" but just the number. My first fuck up was assuming that he was simply just copying off me and nailed the pronunciation; I'm Vietnamese. I've met his parents and been to his family house. His parents came when they were 10 and became super Americanized. No accent in their English, their house looks more like a Asian-American house, and they only speak English with each other. Pretty much I'm assuming they're Chinese. My fuck up came to light when I happen to be at their house when his Aunt visits. His Aunt is not Americanized like his parents and I quickly notice a Vietnamese-English accent. Then I was completely shocked when I saw my bf parents and bf fully conversing in Vietnamese with his Aunt. I pretty much screamed you guys are Vietnamese. My boyfriend and his parents  proceeded to laugh because they thought I had always knew.\n\nTL;DR Dated my boyfriend for 2 years.

For some reason, in the film, they decide to go to Hagrid's house at night despite finding out about the Philosopher's Stone during the day. They have no reason to sneak out, and why would Malfoy have any reason to follow them? Did he skulk around outside the Gryffindor common room waiting for them to make a move? It's just giving them an [l](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall)azy writting so they can be caught and get sentenced to detention in the Forest. In the book, they were out of bed at night because they were trying to smuggle Hagrid's dragon (who had hatched weeks earlier) out of the school. Malfoy knew about this because he'd read a letter in Ron's book about the time and date of when they'd be going out to free the dragon. \n2. in  *Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets* \n\n The Ministry of Magic does not send a letter to the Dursley's house warning Harry for the apparent violation of the Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery after Dobby levitates and drops Petunia's pudding, which is how the Dursleys knew of this rule in the books. How Vernon seems to know of this rule in the following movie, despite noticeably not being aware in this one, is not explained \n\nin  *Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban* \n\n While it's treated as a major reveal in the book, the film never makes it clear that Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs are nicknames used by Remus Lupin, Peter Pettigrew, Sirius Black, and James Potter, respectively.

I guess a richer understanding of psychology and the inner-workings of christianity is the primary reason why I am not christian anymore. Well apart from the fact that there is no good evidence for any god.\n\nIt has been difficult though. Moving away from this unmovable hope was tbh frightening as hell. Not to mention the existential crisis it brings. Like I said, I have been raised in a christian family and all my friends are christian. I am scared that our relationships will fall apart if I open up. You should know that I have seen it, the fear in their eyes when I tell something that is conflicting with their beliefs, the cognitive dissonance.

"books,tyforgottenfish,Created a Book Review Subreddit Called r/BookOpinions,Something I decided to do was create a subreddit called r/BookOpinions where people could go to specifically share thoughts and review books that they have read. The goal of the subreddit is to create an environment where people can share their thoughts good or bad about a book in a respectful way and have civilized discussions with people about the book. We do not want any hate or being rude because of someones opinion. \n\nthe subreddit is still under heavy construction but i wanted to make a bit of a promotional post because there is a post over there already encouraging people to give ideas of what they would like to see on the subreddit. for example weekly post ideas to promote discussion, events we could hold, flairs we could use on the subreddit, rules that you think should be implemented, and whatever someone may think is a good idea. I want to make this subreddit as user friendly as possible so I thought the best thing to do is ask people what they want to see implemented. I already have things like some basic rules setup and i am willing to take any suggestions into consideration to make this subreddit better. Also, I will soon start posting for moderators to join on r/BookOpinions as well. comment and questions or concerns you have and i will answer as many as i can. \n\n[Here is the link to r/BookOpinions if you are interested in joining or sharing some ideas/feeback](https://www.reddit.com/r/BookOpinions/),https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/v4yaqh/created_a_book_review_subreddit_called/,False"

"TwoXChromosomes,kmorrisonismyhero,Can I just have my godamn dream jeans back without an unsolicited d pic,Story time and need to vent. I\u2019m sure i could  certainly be in the wrong here, and honestly I regret this completely and needed to just leave it alone. Two years ago I had just gotten divorced and was dating, I went to see a man I\u2019d been messaging with for a few weeks at his house, his kids were there which made me feel safe (why is that a thing??) and as soon as I arrived the vibe was off, he wasn\u2019t quite the same in person, and felt creepy(not awkward, just creepy) . I had a couple drinks and made conversation because it\u2019s natural to me to make everyone feel comfortable and feigned sleepiness even though he wanted to take things much further, he mostly let me sleep. The next day, after speedily leaving with the knowledge that I\u2019d never return it dawned on me. My god- I\u2019d left behind my prized jeans. They weren\u2019t expensive, they weren\u2019t name brand,  but they were THE jeans. Im talking the best pair you\u2019ve  ever owned- comfy, cute, and fit me like a glove. I felt uncomfortable at the time to reach out after subtly turning him down for a second \u201cdate\u201d and he somewhat respected my wishes and did not push, meanwhile I always longed for my sweet beautiful pants; a year later I\u2019m in a relationship, pregnant, and he reaches out again. I let him know my situation and he says congrats. Fast forward to now: I\u2019ve had my baby, I\u2019m engaged, and happy. I\u2019ve fought every urge to get those beautiful puppy\u2019s back although I\u2019ve missed them with every inch of my being. You just can\u2019t find jeans like that anywhere. Last night I was two margs deep with girlfriends and We got on the topic of clothes that fit perfect and it hit me- my beautiful pair that I swore I could recreate for find something similar, but never did. Hastily and regrettably I messaged this man- not flirty but polite. shot in the dark, \u2018hey those were my favorite pair and if there is any chance they are still in your home could you please mail them to me.\u2019 he tells me he has to ask his girlfriend if she threw them away out of jealousy (HIS WORDS) ok bud ok. and then responds what do ya know I still have them! Great. My best friend tells me to give him her work address so he doesn\u2019t know mine, but before I could Id responded with how they are from Ross and not a name brand so I never could find out how to get a new pair I get a \u201cwhoops\u201d and a fucking dick pic. God damnit. I say \u201cdude I just want my jeans\u201d and here we are, I\u2019m contemplating my stupidity for not just letting them go and giving him an opportunity to do this even though why tf should I be blaming myself when this creeper can\u2019t keep it in his pants.

"personalfinance,chuckamagee,Tax considerations for unmarried expectant parents,My partner and I are expecting our first baby later this year. Marriage is not important to either of us for any religious or personal reasons, though we would not be opposed to getting legally married if it made a material difference to us financially or logistically.\n\nHe owns the house we live in, and we split all our expenses 50/50, other than ongoing house maintenance and repairs, which he pays for. \n\nWe are starting to do the math on the best way to structure our taxes when the baby gets here. Our initial thought is that he, as the higher earner (~$150k/year vs my $140k/year) would claim the baby as a dependent on his returns and file as Head of Household. The difference to our taxes of one parent vs the other claiming the baby isn't huge, but everything I've read online suggests this is the way to go. Our thought is the parent reaping the tax benefit of the baby should contribute that amount into the baby's 529 plan.\n\nHowever, the family health insurance / HSA plan through my employer is more generous than his. A difference of around $4,000 that my employer would contribute to my HSA with a dependent and slightly lower insurance premiums. \n\nDoes his claiming the baby as a dependent on his taxes mean that I cannot put the baby on my health insurance / HSA? \n\nI also have access to a dependent care FSA through work, but I assume I could not use that for a month dependent child. \n\nAnyone else out there in a similar boat?

"nosleep,Wyvernator1,My home has been invaded by something. I am hiding in the attic, Please help. part 1,Hello. My name is Kara Lynx, Please, if you are reading this, send help.\n\nIt's currently 11:15 PM, I am hiding in the attic of a modern, one story large home at Wanderers' Street in the United States. This morning I've been just preparing for work until I saw some sort of figure walking up onto my porch and towards the glass door. \n\nAt first I thought it was a burglar, It was the right side and shape as a fairly large man, I live alone so I resorted to grabbing my handgun I hide in my kitchen counter for emergencies. I went back to the glass door and while on the way yelled to warn the man to leave and that I have a weapon.\n\nIt did not work. I arrived at the door and pointed the gun at the man, Yelling again for them to back off. The man began pounding on the door with his bare fists, it was loud and in the heat of the moment I aimed at his leg and shot, hoping to get him to back the hell off.\n\nUpon being shot, the man made some sort of roar-yell and looked up at me, His face was.... Hairy. There was no mouth, nor nose. It was horrifying, I've seen tens of homeless people or drunks with plenty of hair but it was NOTHING like that. \n\nIt pounded the door even harder, I screamed and shot it, over and over. The bullets went right through this... Thing. No blood spilled on the ground and the holes in its body quickly disappeared just right after being made. It was only getting more angered. It began violently slamming its head against the door, eventually causing the glass to shatter. \n\nI swore under my breath and decided to run.  I made my way to the other side of the house to the main door, grabbing the handle and desperately trying to open the door. Fuck, I left the key in the kitchen. That thing proceeded to chase me and almost cornered me, the only place I could go was up the stairs that are right next to the main door.\n\nI climbed up the stairs, before it could follow me i grabbed my ladder from the side of the upstairs hallway and placed it next to the trapdoor that leads to the attic, Thank God I managed to open it. I crawled up the ladder as fast as I could, the thing was now up the stairs. I went into the attic and kicked the ladder down.\n\nThe disgusting, ugly creature caught up to me and attempted to jump up and reach the trapdoor, I slammed it shut and put a bunch of old junk and boxes on top of it. I waited for tens of minutes, groans and growls and yells came from below me. \n\nBut eventually, it walked away. I carefully shoved the items off the trapdoor and opened it then looked down. Before I could even catch a good glimpse of the hallway I hear rapid footsteps and angry roars coming towards me. I yelped and closed the trapdoor again before I could see it. The snarls and groans continued for another hour or so, all I knew is that this thing doesn't give up easily.\n\nAnd now, we're here. I've sat here for hours, it's not giving up. I'm sitting silently in the attic, writing this on my phone. Fuck, I don't have signal for a call. Great... My phone is at 23% battery already. I need to hurry up with this. Please, If you are reading this, call the police, the neighbor, even come here yourself, WHOEVER! Get me out of here! I will attempt communication if I do not get rescued, but for now I need to save my battery.,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/v4yjs7/my_home_has_been_invaded_by_something_i_am_hiding/,False"

"personalfinance,Snalespune,I live in a HCOL area, all the rentals are around 50% of my income. How can I move out without being broke?,I (27m) live in the greater Seattle area with my parents. I got a new job a couple months ago making $30/hr and working from home 95% of the time. I'm essentially debt free and have $20k+ saved up so I should be able to move out. All that said I really feel like I can't afford an apartment with how expensive housing is here.\n\nThe average 1bed apartment I see around here is $1700-2000 a month before utilities, parking, and fees. Studios are barely(~$100) cheaper and often will not fit both my WFH setup and hobbies desk, let alone a couch. I need to stay in this area for when I do need to go in the office, moving away from the city doesn't help as that puts me on the outskirts of another city in every direction. My $1900 paycheck doesn't seem to go far here.\n\nThe way I see it I essentially have 2 options that make this feasible: Scraping by in the short run hoping to get a higher paying job, or finding a good roommate situation.\n\nI don't know if being rent burdened like that is feasible for more than a year or two. Should I avoid getting a place by myself or will I be fine with some smart budgeting?\n\nRoommates would be a way better financial option but it's a lot trickier to set up right for me. I'm fine with roommates as people, I've done it before, but space is the harder issue. I would need a WFH space, a hobby space, and ideally my own bathroom as I have a health condition that would likely annoy my roommates if we shared. Most roommate situations don't really factor that stuff in, just offering the room. I could get a 2bed/2bath on my own and find a willing roommate later but that would put me in a much harder spot as a first time renter short term.\n\nSo financially, would it be best to get my own big apartment with roommates and suck the temp cost? Stay home until I find a miracle deal? Or am I overthinking this and can totally afford a 1 bed in Seattle?,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/v4yl12/i_live_in_a_hcol_area_all_the_rentals_are_around/,False"

Replied 'When it is better when read at Christmas'.  \n\nThe second time was at my school, where, I was reading Emma by Jane Austen; where a teacher noticed that I was reading it and thought it was weird.

"DIY,ribnag,[Help] Low water pressure (submerged well pump, pressure tank and filters are fine), and I've ruled out everything I can think of; it may be from recent damage, but I don't know how to diagnose it any further.,A week and a half ago I started noticing a drastic drop in my water pressure.  I figured the sediment filter needed changing, or the pressure tank needed a top-up, or worst case I needed yet another new bladder for it.  I finally got around to working on it today, and... I'm totally stumped.\n\nMy pressure tank is right where it should be, at 38psi, and not flooded - In fact, it's totally empty of water, which is part of the problem. As far as I can tell I'm basically running right off the pump at this point, which I realize is just begging for it to burn out in the very near future.  Though interestingly, the pump isn't obviously surging the way it does when a tank fails (it might surge once or twice when I first turn on a faucet, but then just stays steady, if anemic).  Yet another bizarre symptom.\n\nThe gauge on the tee is hovering between not-quite-zero and 20psi, but I don't 100% trust that gauge (it used to work just fine, but that reading just doesn't make any sense to me).  It would pretty much make my day if someone says replace that gauge and everything will be fine, but I'm not holding my breath.\n \nAs the only possible cause I can think of, the cable company ran a conduit under my front yard (it crosses the pipe going to the well) a bit over two weeks ago.  The timing is just too close to ignore, *but*, if that seriously damaged either the pipe or electric to the pump, wouldn't I have no water at all?  Not to mention a lake growing in my yard if I'm losing ~20k gallons a day?  And it didn't go from fine to instantly bad, it was over the course of a few days the pressure went from \"I need to clean the filter\" to \"I hope I don't need a new tank\". \n\nAs an aside, I had an idea to at least buy me some time (if not more water pressure) - If I drop the pressure tank to 8psi and my cut-in to 10, I figured at least it would fill and hopefully reduce the wear on the pump.  Good idea, or dumb (I'm not suggesting that *instead* of a real fix)?\n\nI'm open to just about anything I can possibly test.

I love Lucy, Cheers, Seinfeld, Friends, The Office, Modern Family.....\n\nIt is fairly obvious that when done right, the format of a sitcom is very popular amongst audiences. Even today, shows like Friends, The Office have tons of people around the world who re watch them as comfort food. \n\nYet, I feel like I am seeing less and less of them. We had some great ones in the early 2010s like New Girl, Brooklyn 99 but post 2016, the format seems to have died down quite a bit. \n\nNow days, most comedy shows have 8-10 episodes with each season having an overarching plot. There is nothing wrong with this. I love many shows with this format. \n\nBut it does boggle my mind that streaming services are not green lighting the traditional 22 episodes a season sitcom with great characters where each episode is its own story.\n\nWe always hear about streaming services looking for the \"next Game of Thrones\" . But why aren't more of them looking for the \"next Friends\" or the \"next Office\".\n\nSitcoms can be produced quickly, cheaply and have a large audience when done right.

"personalfinance,SurgySnax,Received money from the sale of my house and looking for guidance,Hello. I (38F) am partnered with my BF (42). I have two children from my previous marriage (divorced 2y), he has one child.\n\nHe makes 40k annually, I make 35k annually. My BF and I rent an apartment that costs us 1.3k monthly. We split rent and utilities 50/50. We keep our finances separate and will always continue to do so.\n\nHe has about 10k in savings, an 50k in an IRA and 25k in a 401k. He has a $200/mo car payment\n\nI don\u2019t have much of a savings\u2014 at most a few hundred. I have 14.7K in 401k (currently set to the lowest contribution to free up funds out of my checks) a couple Acorns accounts valued at $500, and a few shares through Robinhood valued $250. \n\nThis summer I will be able to save some money since I won\u2019t be paying for childcare. That $650 is going to my savings. Otherwise, I live paycheck to paycheck. I have 41k in student loan debt and a $220 monthly lease payment on my car (the lease is up Sept 2023)\n\nThis week, I received 32.5k in equity from the sale of the home I bought with my ex. I paid off my credit cards immediately (3k). \n\nI now have 29.5K sitting in savings. \n\nHere\u2019s are my initial thoughts.\n\n1. BF and I really really want to buy a house. It\u2019s a long-term investment, but we also greatly desire the freedom of having our own space and calling the shots in it. We also need room and a backyard for our 3 kids and 3 pets. Apartment living is terribly expensive, challenging on space, with no investment, and (in our experience) very overbearing management. Renting a house is even more expensive, when our mortgage payment for a similar house would be much less.\n\n The idea of putting the 29k plus some of his savings toward a house is extremely appealing. He has offered to pay 80% of the mortgage for a time so I can build up my savings, while I still maintain legal rights to 50% of our built-up equity+my 29k down should something happen to our relationship. I could save and pay down my student loans while gaining the benefits of home ownership. \n\n2. I could pay down my student loans a ton. I know it needs to be done. They\u2019ve been on my back for two decades. My payment monthly isn\u2019t much ($118) but the interest hurts (5.625%). It feels a bit hopeless. I\u2019d still have 12k left to pay after all of that. But that eliminates any potential down payment for a house\n\n3. buy my car outright right now for $19k to free up the $220/mo to throw into savings. I could even turn around and resell it, pocket the profit (blue book value is 10k more!) and buy a cheaper \u201cget-by\u201d car.\n\n4. ??????\n\nI sit down with a financial planner on the 17th to hash out what to do. In the meantime, thoughts? What on earth is the smartest thing to do with this money?\n\n(ETA more details),https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/v4yu0o/received_money_from_the_sale_of_my_house_and/,False"

"personalfinance,maplepancetta,Someone I know gets 20% cash back on credit card purchases. Is this even possible?,I was admiring my aunt\u2019s jewelry collection and she told me she uses her friend\u2019s card and gets 20% back so it\u2019s a good deal. She said she\u2019d take me if I wanted to purchase anything for a steep discount. I was skeptical but figured if it didn\u2019t work out I could just return whatever I purchased. \n\nWe went to the flagship cartier store and I picked out a bracelet. The friend paid with her card (looked like a regular TD visa) and then a week later she let me know how much I owed her and it was indeed 20% less than what my receipt from the transaction says. I ended up getting over $1500 off. My aunt\u2019s purchases from the same day saved twice as much as I did. \n\nI didn\u2019t want to pry since I don\u2019t know this lady very well and my aunt didn\u2019t say much more than it was some kind of cash back points system but I\u2019m curious since I\u2019ve never heard of such a steep cash back program before. \n\nIt\u2019s also not super appropriate for someone considered a \u201cchild\u201d (I\u2019m 24) to discuss the adults\u2019 financial matters in my culture so I can\u2019t really insist on an explanation.

"nosleep,An_Obscurity_Nodus,My grandfather murdered a lot of people. I just uncovered an even worse secret about my family history.,My grandfather murdered people and liked to bury their dismembered corpses in their own gardens. It would be unfair to call him a serial killer though, because his murders were so prolific and had no real modus operandi. If he couldn\u2019t bury them in the garden, he would simply bury them somewhere in the woods. He wasn\u2019t\u2026organised or attached the way most serial killers are. \n\nStill. He was never arrested. Never caught for his crimes. \n\nI was a quiet kid with workaholic parents. My folks were never there and I was left with relatives a lot growing up which is why I ended up spending a lot of time with my grandfather, my mother\u2019s father.\n\nWhen I was seven years old, my grandfather took me hunting. It wasn\u2019t the kind of hunting where you brought home a deer or a rabbit. Instead, he was going to show me exactly how to deliver a blow to another humans head and then dismember then while they were unconscious but still alive. \n\nMy first kill was supposed to be a boy around my age who had wandered too close to the edge of the woods. He was kicking a ball into a tree. My grandfather nudged me and pointed in the boy\u2019s direction. \n\nObediently, I did as my grandfather said. I walked over to the other boy and smiled widely. Keeping my face warm and open, just as my grandfather taught me. Innocent. \u201cHi.\u201d I said to the boy. I clutched the baseball bat in my hand. He was wearing a red baseball cap and a pair of blue short and he smiled at me. A big grin with two front teeth missing. I think that was what stopped me. \n\nThat was what made me release my grip on the baseball bat and I slowly set it down. It was strange but I felt my grandfather\u2019s glare at that moment, his eyes boring into my back. Panic rose in my throat thinking he was going to strike. \n\nInstead he did something infinitely worse. He killed the boy instead.\n\nI remember numbly sitting in his truck on the drive home. He alternated between shouting at me and calling me a coward while extrapolating joy at his own kill. My fear was palpable. My grandfather was in a state of euphoria and fury. \n\nThat was the last time I saw my grandfather alive.\n\nHe was killed in a hit and run a week later. \n\nI never told a soul about the butchery I had seen in my childhood. A part of me convinced myself that I had it wrong, that I had invented that version of my grandfather because I had misunderstood things. He couldn\u2019t have been a killer, I rationalised, he would have been caught.\n\nI wish that was that my rationality had been right and that would be the end of that. I wish that I didn\u2019t have to tell you about the rest of this. But my grandfather died 23 years ago and four days ago, on my 30th birthday, I  received a \u201cgift.\u201d\n\nIt was delivered in an inconspicuous parcel, my name and address in marker pen. It had no return address and had I known who it was from or what it was, I would have thrown it out. Instead, I took it to my kitchen table along with the rest of my mail and opened it up. \n\nThere was no note inside the package. \n\nJust a sealed box. Carefully I lifted it up and opened it up with my penknife. \n\nThe leather bound, bloodstained notebook stared back at me and a sick feeling clawed its way into my stomach. \n\nCuriosity, however, won out.\n\nI lifted the notebook and grimacing at the crackle of the pages, opened it to the first page which just said a name. \n\nWilliam Ronald Harrow.\n\nThat was my grandfather\u2019s name. My heart began to thud against my chest and my hands shook as I turned the page. \n\nWritten in what I had a horrible suspicion was  dried blood was a name and a date. Gregory Sanders - 12th June 1981. What followed after the name was the most graphically detailed description of murder I had ever read. The thrill the killer took in severing this man\u2019s hands first. The joy he felt in pulling out his vocal cords. How long he kept his victim alive. The torture, my God, the torture.\n\nI turned the page. Another name, another incredibly graphic death.\n\nWhile reading it, a wave of nausea overcame me and as I turned page after page, the strong smell of iron made me drop the book back in its box so I could run to the bathroom and throw up. \n\nWhen I came back, I stood stock still at the kitchen door.\n\nThe diary had moved. \n\nIt was no longer in the box. Instead it sat open at the kitchen counter, lying open on the last page.\n\nLook, I live alone. The front door was locked. No one else had a key after my ex girlfriend moved out and I changed the locks. \n\nA cold sweat broke out all over my body. I felt like I was seven again.\n\nSlowly I made my way to the kitchen counter. I placed my clammy hand on the book and pulled it closer.\n\nThe last page listed a name that made me blink several times.\n\n\u201cWilliam Ronald Harrow - 1st June 1999.\u201d \n\nThat was my grandfather\u2019s name and his date of death. I swallowed hard. What the hell was going on. Slowly I read on. The contents of the page were sickening. In brief, his tongue was cut out. His eyes taken. He was tortured for three days.\n\nI pushed the book away and sat down heavily on a kitchen chair, my head spinning. But\u2026but he died in a car accident didn\u2019t he? That\u2019s why there was a closed casket-\n\nThe realisation suddenly swelled in my mind and I began to realise why there was a closed casket. \n\nIt was because he had been tortured. \n\nQuickly, I grabbed the diary and my keys and drove to my parents\u2019 place. I knew they would be sitting down to dinner around now but I didn\u2019t care. I let myself into the house and found them in their living room.\n\n\u201cSam?! Sam what\u2019s wrong?\u201d My mother asked me, getting to quickly and letting her book fall to the floor.\n\n\u201cHow\u2026how did granddad die?\u201d I didn\u2019t mince my words, I didn\u2019t have the brainpower to do that anymore. \u201cAnd don\u2019t tell me it was a hit and run.\u201d I added forcefully.\n\n\u201cWhat-\u201c my father was standing up too now, his hand on my shoulder. I was breathing hard and my body was a mix of fear and fury.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d I told my father sharply. \u201cI just want the truth.\u201d I turned to my mother. \u201cHow did he die?\u201d\n\nMy mother\u2019s eyes went from confusion to sadness. \u201cOh Sam. You really don\u2019t remember do you?\u201d\n\n\u201cRemember what?!\u201d I asked in frustration.\n\n\u201cWhat he did to Adrian.\u201d Her words were slow, halting and still they managed to make their mark.\n\n\u201cWho is Adrian?\u201d As soon as I asked the question I realised I didn\u2019t want to know the answer but it was too late.\n\nThe room was still as my mother began to cry.\n\n\u201cAdrian was your younger brother. He loved you so much and followed you everywhere. And your grandfather\u2026your grandfather killed him.\u201d\n\nI couldn\u2019t process this. I didn\u2019t have any siblings. I was an only child!\n\n\u201cMom, I don\u2019t remember-\u201c\n\n\u201cNo, you don\u2019t. And that\u2019s a good thing.\u201d My mother said quietly. \u201cThe doctors said it\u2019s best if you don\u2019t remember that day. It\u2019s why we have no photos of Adrian around the house. It\u2019s why we moved to another town where no one knew us or your grandfather. It was so much easier for you to forget.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat happened to him?\u201d My voice sounded high and unnatural even to myself.\n\n\u201cYour grandfather was a sick man.\u201d My mother said, her gentle grey eyes hardening with a hate that made me step back from her. \u201cAnd he got what was coming to him.\u201d\n\nI looked between her and my father, the cold truth dawning on me.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re saying that you\u2026that you-\u201c\n\n\u201cWe did what we had to do. What any parent would do.\u201d said my father, the iciness in his voice chilling me to the core.\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to torture him.\u201d I said numbly, unable to believe that my parents were saying these words.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t have to.\u201d My mothers eyes glinted with something dangerous. \u201cBut we wanted to.\u201d\n\nI stumbled back from my parents. \u201cWho sent me the diary?\u201d \n\n\u201cWhat diary?\u201d My mother asked.\n\n\u201cThis diary!\u201d I said as I slammed it onto the coffee table.\n\nMy mother picked up the diary and flipped through the pages. \u201cI don\u2019t understand. Why are you showing this to us?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d I was incredulous but then I noticed the pages\u2026they were blank. In fact, the whole book seemed to have been wiped clean somehow.\n\nMy head ached. \u201cHow old was he?\u201d I asked softly. \u201cHow old was Adrian?\u201d\n\nMy father was taking a folded photograph out of his wallet, his eyes etched in such pain as he looked at me and handed it over. \u201cThat\u2019s the last photo of you two together.\u201d\n\nIt was an old photograph. Of me and the boy I assumed was my brother. He was smiling a big smile with his two front teeth missing. And wearing a red baseball hat with blue shorts.,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/v4ywoe/my_grandfather_murdered_a_lot_of_people_i_just/,False"

I assume it might vary based on the type of rock, like maybe volcanic rocks are \u201cborn\u201d when they emerge from a volcano, or sedimentary rocks are \u201cborn\u201d when they harden from whatever swampy material they were before, but I\u2019m not sure, and Googling mainly tells me that Dwayne Johnson was born in 1972, which is interesting but not helpful.

"tifu,greenbrownsage,TIFU by spilling tea and being an ass,This just happened like 5 minutes ago and I feel so bad. I ordered tea at my favorite place that I go to all the time, but when I tried my tea, there was no sweetness at all. I payed like 8$ so obviously I'm going to ask them to add sugar to it. (Before you ask yes I did say regular sweetness!) So I ask them to add some sugar and the lady gives it back to me, but I didn't realize they didn't reseal the drink... \nIt's the kind where the machine seals off the top, and you use a pointy straw to stab it through. I went to go and shake it and splattered some tea on the floor, while they're busy too! I felt awful, I really had that fuck up feeling. I immediately apologized and offered to clean it, but the tea maker was like \"It's fine... we'll clean it.\" But I know they didn't want to, and the customers were probably staring at the whole thing. To be honest, not sure if I can show my face there again...\n\nReally hate that I can't show my face there again, I'm so embarrassed. I called my sister after this and she just laughed at me while I was suffering so yeah.\n\nTL:DR I asked my favorite tea place to remake my drink and spilled some all over the floor. :(,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/v4z00n/tifu_by_spilling_tea_and_being_an_ass/,False"

"books,Bundle-of-brindle,The River of Doubt by Candice Millard,I found this book while perusing the bookshelves as a guest at someone\u2019s house (my favorite way to find book recommendations) and, being a sucker for books about Teddy Roosevelt, I immediately checked it out on Libby. \n\nAs far as adventure books go this is right up there with Endurance by Alfred Lansing. Definitely one of the most exciting nonfictions I\u2019ve read so far. \n\nLike I said, I\u2019m a big fan of reading about Roosevelt and getting insights into the life of such a lionized man. River of Doubt does not disappoint. But it was C\u00e2ndido Rondon, one of Brazil\u2019s greatest explorers, that really stood out to me. The lengths he went to to befriend, or at least not antagonize, the natives of the Amazon blew me away. Very rarely do I hear about someone with such strong conviction as him. What these people went through for the sake of exploration is awe inspiring, if not a bit foolhardy.\n\nI haven\u2019t read anything else by Candice Millard yet but I will definitely be checking out more of her work. The storytelling was engaging. The pace felt very much like canoeing down an unknown river. Millard also provides enough detail to empathize with the expedition but not so much as to drag down the story.\n\nI recommend this book if you like adventure stories or Teddy Roosevelt. I highly recommend it if you like both. \n\nAnd if you go on an adventure: pick your crew carefully, pack and prepare well, and don\u2019t f*ck with the Amazon rainforest.,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/v4z3ff/the_river_of_doubt_by_candice_millard/,False"

"nosleep,02321,The Desire For Light Up Shoes,When I was a child, I didn\u2019t really care about getting new video games for presents or the latest flashy toys. Here was one thing I wanted above anything else. A pair of light up shoes. Looking back on it, it feels a little silly I desired them so much. A classmate owned a pair and the moment I saw his steps flashing, I focused on nothing else. \n\nI started doing chores to try and save up money for a pair of shoes. I begged my parents for them, with no luck. I\u2019d just gotten a new pair of shoes before I found out the light up ones existed. We weren\u2019t well off, but we weren\u2019t poor either. They didn\u2019t believe in buying another pair of shoes when I already had a perfectly good pair. They promised they would think about getting the ones I wanted after the first set got worn out. To a child, that felt like forever. My last pair of shoes lasted an entire year and I didn\u2019t want to wait that long. \n\nWhen my classmate found out about how much I wanted his shoes, he playfully teased me about them. His teasing never anything serious. A few months later our class turned on him and said some pretty awful things because he was adopted. I joined in, still bitter about the shoes. I regret what I said and apologize for my words shortly after. He felt hurt by my actions but forgave me. In the back of my mind, I had a feeling if I acted kind to him, he might just give me the shoes because he really didn\u2019t care one way or the other about them. \n\nWe became friends because we lived so close by to each other. When I went to his place, I saw that his father would buy him anything he wanted. You would think that would turn him a bit spoiled but somehow, he acted pretty down to Earth. My childhood friend gladly shared whatever snacks I wanted or let me borrow any toys my family could not afford. I was so thankful he forgave me for my bulling, I did my best to be respectful with him. \n\nBut he refused to give up the shoes. I think the reason why I coveted them so badly was they were just within my reach. I saw them every day, and they didn\u2019t cost an insane amount. That desire, and a mixture of child stupidity led me to do something I\u2019ll always regret. I decided to steal the shoes. \n\nMy chance came when he said his family was going to be gone for a weekend. My heart raced as I thought out my plan. I knew where his house key was hidden. I could just walk in and take them when they were gone. In my room there was a pair of floorboards I could remove and hide stuff inside. My parents didn\u2019t even know about the hiding spot. I could stash the shoes in there. This all would work if he didn\u2019t take the shoes along with him. He'd been wearing them less and less, so there was a good chance of them being left behind. \n\nI didn\u2019t even want to wear them. I just wanted the damn things so bad. I casually walked down the street towards his house, telling my parents that I wanted to the store to buy cheap candy. I saw him get into the family's car with a wave when he spotted me down the street. Before I reached their house, the was long gone.  \n\nI wasn\u2019t going to break into their place in the daylight hours. I would wait until dark. My stomach doing flip flops over the thought of the crime I was going to commit.  \n\nWhen night did come, I nearly backed out of the whole thing. After talking myself into how easy it would be, I crept out of the house for a short walk to his place. My body tensed with stress I thought every neighbor was watching me. Slowly I went up the stairs, looking around expecting to see a neighbor to stop me at any moment. I would prefer the back door, but didn\u2019t know where the key would be hidden. The front door key kept under a happy frog. They really should move it from such an obvious spot.  \n\nThe lock sounded like a bomb going off as I put the key inside and turned it. Holding my breath, I opened the door just enough to slip inside. I shut it behind me as quietly as I possibly could. No one would be home, and yet I didn\u2019t want to risk someone hearing or seeing me. \n\nThe place dark but enough light from the streetlight to see by. I\u2019d hoped the shoes would be by the front door. As I got down low to look through the shoe rack, I heard something. A noise coming from inside the house. I nearly passed out from fear. \n\nMy friend didn\u2019t own any pets. It was the one thing is parents never let him have. I strained to try and hear better. When I didn\u2019t hear anything again, I went back to looking, disappointed when I didn\u2019t see the pair of shoes. There a good chance he kept them in his room. I\u2019ve seen him run through the house to go to the washroom the moment he got home, to kick his shoes off in his room when he was finished. I look in there, then leave. \n\nAs I silently made my way towards the stairs, I heard the sound again. It sounded like a voice; I was sure of it. I should have run. I shouldn\u2019t have ever come there.  The hint of the sound came again and I followed it. My feet creaking the floorboards as I went. If someone was home, I could be caught. But this sound almost like a hurt puppy. I needed to figure out what was going on. \n\nThe soft whining came from the basement door. My palms were sweating as I stared at the closed door trying to figure out what to do. I didn\u2019t want to leave a suffering animal behind, but if the animal was too badly hurt, I would need to call an adult for help. I would just go down and see what I could do. The basement had windows so maybe some sort of animal got inside and got hurt somewhere. \n\nGathering all my courage, I opened the door and made my way down the old wooden steps. There was a light on somewhere in the basement. Did they forgot to turn it off when they left? It wasn\u2019t enough to fill the entire room, but I could see where to walk. The basement floor a cold cement that muffled my footsteps. \n\nThe ceiling was exposed and covered with cobweb, making my skin crawl at the sight. I was told this is where my friend's father stored all his tools and other stuff. We weren\u2019t allowed down there. His parents claiming to be too messy and a bit dangerous with sharp objects on the shelves. When I reached the bottom of the stairs, I looked around. Tall shelving crammed the space. The place dusty as if none of these tools were ever used. And each looked pretty different from one another. I didn\u2019t know what his father did to need such a large arrange of things. Maybe he bought and sold them. Something from every trade down here on the shelves.  \n\nI could hear the whining sound better now. As I walked between shelves, I did my best not to get caught on anything sticking out. Just as I turned the corner, I froze when the sound turned into a word. Someone begged for help. I almost fainted from how scared I felt. Someone was down here, not an animal like I first assumed. \n\nI could peek between the clutter into the open space beyond instead of walking around the shelf. What I saw made my mouth dry. In that dingy basement, a man sat, strapped down to a chair. Someone I've never seen before. Tears stained his face and the tips of his fingers bloody. It took me a second to realize the blood came from the fact was missing his fingernails. \n\nI took a step back to leave when another figure came into view. I couldn\u2019t risk moving and being heard. I stayed, watching the horrible scene play out. \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re really making this harder on yourself. If you just gave me the names of your friends, we could end this.\u201d \n\nMy heart nearly stopped when I recognized that upbeat tone It was my friend's father, the kind man I\u2019ve come to respect. His hands stained with blood as he set down some pliers on a table next to the chair. I choked on my fear but still didn\u2019t move. \n\n\u201cPlease, I don\u2019t know them. I gave you everything I had. We just exchange some videos, that\u2019s all. I'm not the one recording them. I don\u2019t deserve this...\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never seen a grown man cry before. His captor let him sob for a few moments until he got on his level. Eye to eye, his tone dropped down disgusted with the man he tortured.  \n\n\u201cThose were children in those videos. You supported that. You have earned far more pain that I can give. If you have no names for me, you\u2019re useless.\u201d \n\nReaching over, he plucked a pair of long scissors and a clamp from the table. His back facing me so I didn\u2019t know what his expression looked like in that moment. This person no longer the kind father I\u2019ve gotten to know but a monster. The other man thrashed trying to get away as the clamp came down on one of his fingers. The scissors hovering ominously in the air. The moment before the blades came down, the man cracked. Through sobs he started to list email addresses and online names.  \n\nHis captor paused to write down what was being said acting so calm over the whole thing. He even took all the passwords for the man\u2019s accounts so he could investigate further. It felt like ages as the sobbing man listed off names and numbers. My feet hurt from standing for so long, and body trembled from fear. \n\nAfter he got everything, he could, the father started to cut the tape keeping the man bound. He warned if he made a run for it, he would kill him. The other person too in shock to move. Even after his binds were cut, he didn\u2019t believe he could go free.  \n\n\u201cI swear, I won\u2019t ever watch those kinds of videos again, I won\u2019t even go near another kid until I die...\u201d He sobbed still in the chair. \n\n\u201cLet me tell you something, I didn\u2019t care about children for a long time. I could kill one without a second thought. It wasn\u2019t until I settled down into this life, I changed my focus on what kind of lives I took. And I need to take them. Because I am very hungry. Oh, so very hungry....\u201d \n\nUnable to hold back a scream, I yelped when the father\u2019s face twisted and changed. Looking no longer human, but some sort of beast with a face that mostly made of jaws. My scream was drowned out by the other man. He got up and tripped over the chair before the monster caught him. Those jaws tearing into his flesh, taking chucks off the body and causing blood to fly everywhere. \n\nI heard the sounds of that man being eaten alive. I curled up against the shelf, so scared I couldn\u2019t move. I just sobbed wanting to go home and regretting my choices. As the sounds died down, I knew I've been caught. I should have been the one eaten next. A hand landed on my shoulder and I screamed, completely out of my mind.  \n\nThe hand stayed until I calmed down enough to face the father. His humans face stained with blood, and silver eyes staring down at me in the dark. \n\n\u201cSweetheart, what are you doing here?\u201d He asked in a sweet tone that made me sick. \n\nI broke, sobbing and explained why I broke in. It was all because of those damn shoes. I kept apologizing for breaking into his place and swearing I would never tell a soul of what I saw. He laughed at the small frantic child sobbing in front of him. In fact, he laughed so hard he choked. Wiping tears from his eyes, he lifted me to my feet to usher me out of the basement.  \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re adorable. Don\u2019t worry about anything happening to you. I promise not to tell anyone you broke in if you promise not to tell your parents what you saw tonight.\u201d \n\nI nodded unable to speak. I would never be able to bring this up to them. I expected him to simply walk me out the door, but he quickly washed his face and changed his clothing. My parents noticed their child missing and went to the street calling my name. He walked over, small scared child in hand. He said I\u2019d gone to the store for a snack run, but got lost. By chance he\u2019d come across me and brought me home. Somehow my parents believed him. He gave us a wave as I was carried by my father back home. He watched, smile hiding a dark secret only I knew. \n\nA few months passed by. My friend still wanted to hang out with me but I couldn\u2019t bring myself to go to his place. I could tell he didn\u2019t have a clue on what his adopted father kept hidden. At least he would be safe with that monster.  He broke the news his family would be moving before the winter. I was going to miss him, even after everything. Before he left, he showed up at my place with a box. Since we weren\u2019t going to see each other at Christmas, he wanted to give me my gift early. I felt totally puzzled over what could be inside. \n\nI tore off the delicate red wrapping paper and opened the box. My breath caught when I saw a pair of new light up shoes tucked inside tissue paper. My friend completely unaware of why the sight of them made my face turn pale. I did my best to act natural and thanked him for the thoughtful gift. After he left, I hid those shoes away, never to touch them or even take them out of the box. Since then, I have never coveted something to such an extent and my life is much better for it.,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/v4z4x4/the_desire_for_light_up_shoes/,False"

I kept working with him, focusing on his routine and what he did during, and after the work. I had to know more about T for my plan to be put in motion. \n\nWhile I was studying T, something clicked in my mind, I didn't know where T lived. We would usually finish the work and he would head in deeper into the forest while I would make my way out of it. I only know this because I stayed a bit later after we finished work, hiding in the woods watching him. \n\nHe would always stay inside the warehouse after me, waiting for me to leave before he did so himself. One friday night, we had more bodies delivered to us than we were used to, most likely a gang shooting but I didn't know, nor did I want to. \n\nIt was already past my usual working time but I had already started getting rid of one of the bodies, so I told T I would stay an hour or 2 longer to finish it up and that he can go home if he wants. T agreed. He told me to lock up behind me when I was finished. \n\nThis is the opportunity I was waiting for, I'm finally be able to follow him into the woods to see where he lived. I acted natural as he changed clothes and after he left I waited for a bit before opening the door myself. \n\nI grabbed a pack of bandaids and slowly followed him into the woods, making sure I wouldn't make any sounds. I stuck the bandaids on trees to be able to find my way back to the warehouse. I followed him, navigating the woods with precision so I don't step on any branches. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes I could see a small clearing and a house inside of it. As I neared it to get a better look I wasn't paying attention to the ground anymore. I stepped on a branch and it cracked loudly under me. I instinctively ducked under a bush as I saw his head snap back. \n\nMy heart was pumping in my chest threatening to jump out any minute. Adrenaline was rushing trough my body but after about a minute of nothing happening I peeked out slowly. I saw him getting to the front door of the house as he glanced one last time at the woods behind before he went in. \n\nI calmed my breathing down a bit as I made my way back to the warehouse, making sure to take every bandaid off of the trees so that he wouldn't see them. I got back, finished up the body that I promised I would, and made my way back to my friends house. \n\nWhen I got back to my house, I couldn't sleep, the only thing I could focus on was how to find a way how to get into the house itself. The task wasn't going to be easy and it would take a lot of risk but if it worked, it would be a big step closer in making my plan a success. \n\nThe next day at work I got there a bit later and as I was changing my clothes I decided to look trough his clothes if he had a key to the house. I peeked out of the room, and when I was sure he wasn't close I looked trough his clothes. At first I didn't find anything, until I got to his coat that was hanging on the wall. I put my hand in the left pocket and I felt keys, when I got them out of the pocket I noticed there was 2 keys that looked similar to the ones for our warehouse, but they weren't the same. \n\nI decided to change one of the keys for my own warehouse key, hoping it was the key to his house. I had my fingers crossed he wouldn't notice the difference, at least not immidiately. I had to wait for him to get distracted by something, however, so that I could have enough time to swap the keys. \n\nI didn't have to wait for too long, because he got a call to pick up a body. That was my opportunity to change one the keys with my own. I changed as fast as I could, not wasting any more time than necessary. \n\nI got back to work, holding in my excitement. In the meantime T came back with the new body and the day went by as usual. Once we were finished I pretended to go home but I hid behind one of the trees and waited for T to start making his way back to his house. \n\nI followed him carefully, this time not needing the bandaids since the way back was still fresh in my memory, and it wasn't that difficult. I made sure not to make any noises to alert him this time, calculating every step I took. Too much was at stake and I had gotten too far to get caught. \n\nHe made his way into his house and closed the door. I decided to stay there and watch him for a while, hoping he would decide to go somewhere. I decided to make my way a bit closer but still hiding in between the trees in case he decided to come out again. \n\nI watched him for an hour or so, before the lights in the house turned off. I figured he was most likely going to sleep so I decided to call it a night and try my luck again tommorow. \n\nWhen I got back to my friends house he was already waiting for me. He said he had something important to talk about.\nWe sat down and he started talking about my parents and my ex girlfriend missing at the same time. I played dumb, acting like I didn't know what could have possibly happened to them. I was heartbroken so I didn't have to fake my tears when I cried. He said he was sorry that he even brought that up but something about it was bugging him so he just wanted to know if I knew who could've done it. \n\nI said no and as I turned to leave he said \"You should take a break, you've been working overtime a lot lately from what I can see.\" \n\nI just nodded my head as I kept my eyes to the ground, feeling disgusted by what I've done with my life. \n\nThe next day went as usual, we worked on some bodies until it was time to go home. Just like the night before, I waited for him to leave and followed him back to his house. This time I was feeling a bit more courageous and I got even closer to the house. I tried to see something trough his windows but I couldn't see much of interest. \n\nThat is untill lights in one of the rooms turned on and he went into it. It looked like an office and he looked inside one of the drawers as he pulled out a file and dialed a number on his phone. It seemed like the person on the other side picked up and after a while of them talking, they hung up. After some more time has passed the lights went out once again. I made my way back to my friends house and went to sleep. \n\nThat night I had nightmares and I couldn't sleep well. Something in my mind told me I saw something I shouldn't that night. I went to work but I noticed how T was in a much friendlier mood than before, even cracking couple of jokes. I endured through it and when the time came I followed him back to his house. I took the same spot I had the night before but this time the lights turned off really early and I saw T getting out of the house and making his way back to the warehouse. \n\nI didn't know what he was up to, but this may have been my only chance to get into his house and look around. When I made sure he was gone I rushed to the house and unlocked it. I went in and decided not to turn on any lights, using the flashlight on my phone instead. I made the way to what I assumed was his office and I shined my light over the file that was on his table. \n\nThe file said \"Darren Johnson\". That was my name, why did he have my full name on a file when I never even told him any of my information. I opened the file and I felt my heart sink to my stomach. He had all of the information about about my parents and my ex girlfriend. \n\nMy parents and my girlfriend were scratched off but there was one more person at the bottom of the page that wasn't. It was my friend that took me in to live with him, under his information it said \"Hit, 5am when he's leaving for work.\" \n\nI was shocked I didn't know what to think. If I was right my friend is the one that's going to be killed next, possibly tommorow as he is leaving for work. I couldn't let that happen, I already lost too much to these monsters. \n\nI got out of his house, locked the door and rushed back to my friends house. I spent the night phisically and mentally preparing myself for all of the scenarios that could happen. \n\nI took one of my friends work outfits from our closet and decided to go out at 4:40am. I knew the hitman would be somewhere where he could see my friend leaving the house and I knew he wouldn't use a pistol unless he absolutely had to, we were living in the city after all. \n\nI leave the house and turn down one of the alleys after a minute of walking. I walked for a bit and then stopped, pretending to be looking at my phone. What I was actually looking at was the reflection behind me. \n\nI saw a man silently approaching, unaware I can see him as he silently pulled out a knife from his waistband, I did the same, just less noticably. I had to time this perfectly, I had the element of suprise but he was a trained hitman. I waited for him to get close enough that I would be able to attack him. I turned around and swung my knife in a horizontal motion where his throat was. \n\nHe gurgled and a look of shock enveloped his face as he fell down and took last of his breaths. I took his phone and saw a familiar number that belonged to T in his recent contacts. It said Taylor, so I guess now I know his name too. I took the phone with me and put the body in the trunk of my car. \n\nI drove to the usual location we picked up the bodies from and I callee Taylor. I told him the body was ready and he hung up the phone. I hid in one of the bushes nearby and waited for Taylor to come. When he came and went to the body I could see his body tense up. \n\nI slowly made my way out of the bushes and cocked the gun that I took from the hitman. He turned around fear on his face. \n\n\"What the fuck are you doing? Put that down now!\" He yelled even though we both knew he didn't have any control of the situation. \n\n\"Why?\" Is the only thing I said, leveling my gun to his head. \n\n\"Listen, I wanted to make sure you wouldn't have a reason to leave, I needed a partner and you did well!\" He said as I looked at him with disgust. \n\n\"Yeah, bad move.\" I said as I pulled the trigger three times, his body falling lifeless on top of the hitman. \n\nThis has brought me to insanity, I couldn't live a normal life, not anymore, not after all of the shit I did. I'm a criminal now, and I have to accept it. \n\nI'm sorry, but I have to leave, someone called the number from my ad on the dark web, and I need a new partner, I have 2 bodies to clean up.,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/v4z9fj/i_found_a_job_on_dark_web_it_backfired_part_2end/,False"

"books,ACardAttack,Battle Royal is an absolute thriller and action packed page turner,What an absolutely thrilling and addictive book.\n\nI ended up liking a good amount of the characters that we met, even if for a short while the author did a good job of humanizing most of them. The book is entirely tense. I found myself covering up the end of each chapter as it told you how many students were left and I didnt want to spoil anything until I read it.\n\nI've seen the movie, but it has been awhile and Im sure some things have changed, but it helped as I was familiar with a few of the scenes. The violence was beautifully described and not for the faint of heart.\n\nI had a couple minor problems. The first was the reason for the government doing this every year, it seems counter intuitive based on the state of the country, but then it is better explained at the end. The two unanswered issues were 1. the main anthologist's main gun seemed to have a crazy amount of ammo. Yes they pick up other people's weapons and guns, but they're all different and 2 none of the deaths felt cheap, but boy did a lot of people not check to see if their opponent died before letting their guard down. Follow the Godfather's advice, two in the head (and leave the gun and take the cannoli)\n\nOverall it was a wonderful thriller that is despite its length a fast and easy read. I do recommend searching for a character list to help you keep track of who is who and who has died\n\nI used these two\n\n[Spoiler free character guide](https://www.goodreads.com/topic/show/633481-guide-to-remembering-the-characters)\n\n[Pictures](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/battleroyale/images/8/88/BRMangaCharacters.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20081115173537)\n\nWho else has read this?,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/v4zi30/battle_royal_is_an_absolute_thriller_and_action/,False"

"nosleep,SuckitUpPuss,I Found A Job On Dark Web, It Backfired [PART 2],[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/v49rfh/i_found_a_job_on_dark_web_it_backfired_part_1/)\n\nI couldn't rush my decision or my plan, I had to keep a low profile not to look suspicious. I kept working with him, focusing on his routine and what he did during, and after the work. I had to know more about T for my plan to be put in motion. \n\nWhile I was studying T, something clicked in my mind, I didn't know where T lived. We would usually finish the work and he would head in deeper into the forest while I would make my way out of it. I only know this because I stayed a bit later after we finished work, hiding in the woods watching him. \n\nHe would always stay inside the warehouse after me, waiting for me to leave before he did so himself. One friday night, we had more bodies delivered to us than we were used to, most likely a gang shooting but I didn't know, nor did I want to. \n\nIt was already past my usual working time but I had already started getting rid of one of the bodies, so I told T I would stay an hour or 2 longer to finish it up and that he can go home if he wants. T agreed. He told me to lock up behind me when I was finished. \n\nThis is the opportunity I was waiting for, I'm finally be able to follow him into the woods to see where he lived. I acted natural as he changed clothes and after he left I waited for a bit before opening the door myself. \n\nI grabbed a pack of bandaids and slowly followed him into the woods, making sure I wouldn't make any sounds. I stuck the bandaids on trees to be able to find my way back to the warehouse. I followed him, navigating the woods with precision so I don't step on any branches. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes I could see a small clearing and a house inside of it. As I neared it to get a better look I wasn't paying attention to the ground anymore. I stepped on a branch and it cracked loudly under me. I instinctively ducked under a bush as I saw his head snap back. \n\nMy heart was pumping in my chest threatening to jump out any minute. Adrenaline was rushing trough my body but after about a minute of nothing happening I peeked out slowly. I saw him getting to the front door of the house as he glanced one last time at the woods behind before he went in. \n\nI calmed my breathing down a bit as I made my way back to the warehouse, making sure to take every bandaid off of the trees so that he wouldn't see them. I got back, finished up the body that I promised I would, and made my way back to my friends house. \n\nWhen I got back to my house, I couldn't sleep, the only thing I could focus on was how to find a way how to get into the house itself. The task wasn't going to be easy and it would take a lot of risk but if it worked, it would be a big step closer in making my plan a success. \n\nThe next day at work I got there a bit later and as I was changing my clothes I decided to look trough his clothes if he had a key to the house. I peeked out of the room, and when I was sure he wasn't close I looked trough his clothes. At first I didn't find anything, until I got to his coat that was hanging on the wall. I put my hand in the left pocket and I felt keys, when I got them out of the pocket I noticed there was 2 keys that looked similar to the ones for our warehouse, but they weren't the same. \n\nI decided to change one of the keys for my own warehouse key, hoping it was the key to his house. I had my fingers crossed he wouldn't notice the difference, at least not immidiately. I had to wait for him to get distracted by something, however, so that I could have enough time to swap the keys. \n\nI didn't have to wait for too long, because he got a call to pick up a body. That was my opportunity to change one the keys with my own. I changed as fast as I could, not wasting any more time than necessary. \n\nI got back to work, holding in my excitement. In the meantime T came back with the new body and the day went by as usual. Once we were finished I pretended to go home but I hid behind one of the trees and waited for T to start making his way back to his house. \n\nI followed him carefully, this time not needing the bandaids since the way back was still fresh in my memory, and it wasn't that difficult. I made sure not to make any noises to alert him this time, calculating every step I took. Too much was at stake and I had gotten too far to get caught. \n\nHe made his way into his house and closed the door. I decided to stay there and watch him for a while, hoping he would decide to go somewhere. I decided to make my way a bit closer but still hiding in between the trees in case he decided to come out again. \n\nI watched him for an hour or so, before the lights in the house turned off. I figured he was most likely going to sleep so I decided to call it a night and try my luck again tommorow. \n\nWhen I got back to my friends house he was already waiting for me. He said he had something important to talk about.\nWe sat down and he started talking about my parents and my ex girlfriend missing at the same time. I played dumb, acting like I didn't know what could have possibly happened to them. I was heartbroken so I didn't have to fake my tears when I cried. He said he was sorry that he even brought that up but something about it was bugging him so he just wanted to know if I knew who could've done it. \n\nI said no and as I turned to leave he said \"You should take a break, you've been working overtime a lot lately from what I can see.\" \n\nI just nodded my head as I kept my eyes to the ground, feeling disgusted by what I've done with my life. \n\nThe next day went as usual, we worked on some bodies until it was time to go home. Just like the night before, I waited for him to leave and followed him back to his house. This time I was feeling a bit more courageous and I got even closer to the house. I tried to see something trough his windows but I couldn't see much of interest. \n\nThat is untill lights in one of the rooms turned on and he went into it. It looked like an office and he looked inside one of the drawers as he pulled out a file and dialed a number on his phone. It seemed like the person on the other side picked up and after a while of them talking, they hung up. After some more time has passed the lights went out once again. I made my way back to my friends house and went to sleep. \n\nThat night I had nightmares and I couldn't sleep well. Something in my mind told me I saw something I shouldn't that night. I went to work but I noticed how T was in a much friendlier mood than before, even cracking couple of jokes. I endured through it and when the time came I followed him back to his house. I took the same spot I had the night before but this time the lights turned off really early and I saw T getting out of the house and making his way back to the warehouse. \n\nI didn't know what he was up to, but this may have been my only chance to get into his house and look around. When I made sure he was gone I rushed to the house and unlocked it. I went in and decided not to turn on any lights, using the flashlight on my phone instead. I made the way to what I assumed was his office and I shined my light over the file that was on his table. \n\nThe file said \"Darren Johnson\". That was my name, why did he have my full name on a file when I never even told him any of my information. I opened the file and I felt my heart sink to my stomach. He had all of the information about about my parents and my ex girlfriend. \n\nMy parents and my girlfriend were scratched off but there was one more person at the bottom of the page that wasn't. It was my friend that took me in to live with him, under his information it said \"Hit, 5am when he's leaving for work.\" \n\nI was shocked I didn't know what to think. If I was right my friend is the one that's going to be killed next, possibly tommorow as he is leaving for work. I couldn't let that happen, I already lost too much to these monsters. \n\nI got out of his house, locked the door and rushed back to my friends house. I spent the night phisically and mentally preparing myself for all of the scenarios that could happen. \n\nI took one of my friends work outfits from our closet and decided to go out at 4:40am. I knew the hitman would be somewhere where he could see my friend leaving the house and I knew he wouldn't use a pistol unless he absolutely had to, we were living in the city after all. \n\nI leave the house and turn down one of the alleys after a minute of walking. I walked for a bit and then stopped, pretending to be looking at my phone. What I was actually looking at was the reflection behind me. \n\nI saw a man silently approaching, unaware I can see him as he silently pulled out a knife from his waistband, I did the same, just less noticably. I had to time this perfectly, I had the element of suprise but he was a trained hitman. I waited for him to get close enough that I would be able to attack him. I turned around and swung my knife in a horizontal motion where his throat was. \n\nHe gurgled and a look of shock enveloped his face as he fell down and took last of his breaths. I took his phone and saw a familiar number that belonged to T in his recent contacts. It said Taylor, so I guess now I know his name too. I took the phone with me and put the body in the trunk of my car. \n\nI drove to the usual location we picked up the bodies from and I callee Taylor. I told him the body was ready and he hung up the phone. I hid in one of the bushes nearby and waited for Taylor to come. When he came and went to the body I could see his body tense up. \n\nI slowly made my way out of the bushes and cocked the gun that I took from the hitman. He turned around fear on his face. \n\n\"What the fuck are you doing? Put that down now!\" He yelled even though we both knew he didn't have any control of the situation. \n\n\"Why?\" Is the only thing I said, leveling my gun to his head. \n\n\"Listen, I wanted to make sure you wouldn't have a reason to leave, I needed a partner and you did well!\" He said as I looked at him with disgust. \n\n\"Yeah, bad move.\" I said as I pulled the trigger three times, his body falling lifeless on top of the hitman. \n\nThis has brought me to insanity, I couldn't live a normal life, not anymore, not after all of the shit I did. I'm a criminal now, and I have to accept it. \n\nI'm sorry, but I have to leave, someone called the number from my ad on the dark web, and I need a new partner, I have 2 bodies to clean up.,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/v4zk0s/i_found_a_job_on_dark_web_it_backfired_part_2/,False"

"television,nevereatpears,Julia Garner (Ruth) blows everyone else away on Ozark - what a performance! Steals every scene,I'm currently only midway through the second season of Ozark and I have been absolutely gobsmacked by Julia Garner's performance.\n\nShe plays Ruth Langmore, a criminal who gets involved in Marty's schemes. \n\nI've just seen she won two Emmys for her performance on the show and boy did she earn those just going by what I've seen.\n\nShe is so utterly convincing as Ruth. She steals every scene,she is in. What a powerhouse performance. Bravo, Julia!\n\nI don't mean to put any of the other actors down, they do a great job with what they're given, but Julia is just on another level.\n\nI feel like I am very late on the bus with this whole take - but I have been watching her awe struck and just had to say something.\n\nShe makes a potentially unlikeable character not just someone you root for, but so layered multidimensional, relatable and sassy.\n\nIt sort of reminds me of Walton Goggins' performance in Justified.

"nosleep,LastAngelStanding,The Last Testament of New Troy,Hello, my name is Gael Daly. I am a former deputy of the New Troy Sheriff Office. I don\u2019t know what efforts have been made to save New Troy, Utah, but it\u2019s too late for us. By the time you have finished reading, the last survivors and I will all be dead. At this time please, for your own safety, cease any rescue attempts being made. You do not want to release what has taken New Troy. \n\nOur last wish was to spread our final story as far and wide as we can in hopes the outside world may know what happened to us. We don\u2019t want to be dramatized into some unsolvable mystery where nothing more than some old photos of us show on the screen. We are real people and we want to be remembered with reverence and dignity. There are two others with me, each of us will tell what we saw during the day the sky went black. We give you our stories and our final days so we may be lost but not forgotten.\n\nI will start it myself. Gael Daly, born of Irish immigrants (with a name like this who could have guessed, right?) Sean and Clara Daly. My mom and pop moved to the states near the tail end of The Troubles. I was born a natural American citizen but my pops didn\u2019t want me to lose my roots. They didn\u2019t know how to do much more than farm, so that\u2019s what they did. Pops would spend sunrise to sunset out in the fields while mom and I herded sheep. We converted to The Church of Latter Day Saints, or Mormons as they are more commonly known. No, not the polygamy ones, those are the FLDS and they live more in the four corners evading the law. Growing up I always had an affinity for playing the good guy. I never found it boring, I just like doing the right thing and enjoy helping people. That\u2019s why I joined the New Troy Sheriff Office. That is the man I am, or maybe the man I was. \n\nYou aren\u2019t reading for my personal memoirs though, I already know. You want to know what happened the day the sky went black. I don\u2019t blame you, I would wonder too. In short, Hell came to Earth and swallowed our whole town. \n\nI was on duty that day. April 24th, the last day I remember. I was performing some good ol\u2019 community bonding, just walking down the street, offering my help where I could. Not much crime happens around these parts so instead I make myself more of a handyman most days. Edith, a kind old woman who was the residential grandma, waved me over. Her car had hit a nail and now she had a flat tire. I popped open her trunk and got to changing the tire when it happened. It was like a sheet was pulled over our heads. In one great line, darkness slowly enveloped the entire sky. The sun was gone, the moon was gone, stars were gone, everything. I remember thinking to myself \u201cThis is exactly how I imagined outer darkness would look.\u201d and I had no clue at the time how accurate I was. \n\nThe strangest thing of all when the darkness enveloped us, was that for a while nothing else changed. The temperature didn\u2019t even drop. Street lights turned on, homes and businesses lit up, it was like we all subconsciously agreed this was just an unexpected solar eclipse that would pass any moment. Edith was as puzzled as I was, but I soon got her tire changed and she was on the road again. I kept checking my radio, expecting something to explain this, but nothing was coming through. I decided to return to the office and try to get some answers. Along the way multiple friends and neighbors questioned me, but I had no comfort to offer them. \n\nAt the office phones were in a frenzy and our poor dispatchers were overwhelmed with the amount of calls coming in. Sheriff Gaberiel Brady, Gabe as we all called him, had been trying to make contact with any of the neighboring towns for the past half hour. \n\n\u201cCan\u2019t one of these lazy fuckers pick up a god damn phone?\u201d Gabe tore the old phone from his desk and threw it across the room. \u201cFor now, we just tell everyone to stay calm and remain indoors. If any emergencies arise, we send Gael or Sherry out.\u201d Gabe looked up from his desk and finally noticed me standing in the doorway. \u201cIs that good with you Son?\u201d\n\n\u201cAll good with me Sir. No incidents on my way back, so I think other than missing the Sun we are fine.\u201d I took a deep breath as Gabe strode on up and clapped me on the shoulder. \n\n\u201cGood son, very good. You\u2019re going to be looking at a promotion after this mess.\u201d He roared with laughter and everyone in the office felt a little better. Gabe was your stereotypical western cowboy lawman and he loved every bit of it. From his horseshoe mustache to his 10 gallon hat he was born to a sheriff, granted born a little late. \n\n\u201cSherry! Are you still here?\u201d Gabe shouted up the stairs. \n\n\u201cYes Sir! No luck on the internet though. It\u2019s odd. I can send things, but I haven\u2019t received anything. Things will load, but nothing is older than 3:19 today. You think this might be affecting more than just us?\u201d Sherry shouts down to us from her workstation. Gabe made our offices upstairs so he didn\u2019t have to walk up and down the stairs every day.\n\n\u201cI have no clue. I certainly hope not. Can you get any messaging to work? Email, Phone, hell I\u2019ll even let you tweet it.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo far no good. Let me try\u2026 Debbie! Check your email!\u201d Sherry shouted as she rushed down the stairs and ran up to Debbie's side.\n\n\u201cOh! Okay.\u201d Debbie hung up her current call and turned to her computer. Opening her email there was one new message. \u201cTest\u201d from Sherry.\n\n\u201cYeah! It went through Sherry!\u201d Debbie beamed up at Sherry. The first good news all day. \n\n\u201cAwesome! Try replying to it. I want to see if I can receive anything.\u201d Sherry ran back up to her office.\n\n\u201cOkay. Sent! Did you get it Sherry?\u201d Debbie shouted upstairs. It was odd hearing her yell, she\u2019s pretty shy and more likely to mutter than anything. I could feel myself smiling at her new found courage.\n\n\u201cI got it too! Emails work boss! I\u2019ll start sending one to every PD I can think of. Just send Gael out for whatever until I get done. Somebody is going to respond eventually.\u201d Sherry was officially glued to her seat and there was no arguing with her now. With a sigh Gabe turned to me.\n\n\u201cThink you can handle things by yourself for a bit, son?\u201d\n\n\u201cSure thing Sir. Leave it to me.\u201d I went over to sit by Debbie and Shawn as they continued to take calls. Once one of those calls was a true call for help, instead of a question, I was going to be ready to go. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m heading towards the edge of town. Stay on radio, I\u2019ll let you know if I can find the point where this thing ends.\u201d With a pat on the back Gabe strode out to his cruiser, flicked the lights on, and drove off into the distance. That was the last we ever saw of him. \n\nIt didn\u2019t take much longer before things really started kicking off. We got a call from Jason about Edith. Jason had been Edith\u2019s neighbor and volunteer caretaker for quite some time now. Under normal circumstances we would be calling him if she ever needed any help.\n\n\u201cHey, I think all the stress has been too much for Edith. She\u2019s been standing outside of my door knocking ever since she came home. I tried asking her what she needs but she won\u2019t answer, she just keeps knocking. She\u2019s being really strange and I\u2019m worried she might hurt herself. I don\u2019t think I can handle this alone.\u201d Faint knocking could be heard in the background of the call. Rhythmic, almost like clockwork. Knock-knock-knock-knock. Pause. Knock-knock-knock-knock. Pause. Knock-knock-knock-knock. \n\nI didn\u2019t even wait for Debbie to respond. I\u2019d just been with Edith, she\u2019d been a little unnerved but seemed fine earlier. I was probably the best chance of getting her whatever help she needed without injury. I drove cautiously through town. The street lights seemed to light a majority of the road up, but anything to the side was shrouded in darkness. Even living here all my life, I had to use my searchlight on the houses to find Jason\u2019s. When I did, Edith was still there, still knocking.\n\n\u201cEdith, are you alright? What\u2019s going on?\u201d I made my presence known so that I didn\u2019t startle her. Last thing we needed was for me to give her a heart attack on top of whatever is going on. Edith turned slowly towards me with an unnaturally wide smile on her face.\n\n\u201cGood Deputy! I\u2019m so glad you came. I need to feed my cat but I can\u2019t find any of the lights in my house. Will you please help me?\u201d Despite her smile her speech was lacking in emotion, an odd thing for the usually bubbly and kind old woman. It was almost as odd as her request. She doesn\u2019t own a cat or even a dog. She is allergic and far beyond the physical capability to take care of a pet.\n\n\u201cRight! Your cat. Sweet flufferkins. She must be hungry, let's go.\u201d I followed behind Edith as she waddled back towards her house. Jason stared at me through the window and I gave him a reassuring nod as we walked past. Edith\u2019s car was in the driveway, headlights off but still running. She walked past the car with no hesitation, into the already wide open front door to her house. I quickly turned the car off and pocketed her keys before walking inside after her. I tried flicking the light switch but nothing was coming on. Strange, all the other houses had their electricity working. I turned on my flashlight instead and scanned the room. In the corner of the living room I saw something scurry away from the light and Edith slammed the door behind me.\n\nI spun around fast enough to catch a glimpse of her before she was on top of me. Black tendrils had replaced her arms and sprouted from her back. Her eyes were completely blackened as well and she screeched in my face as she wrapped her tendrils around my neck and arms. I tried to reach for my gun, my taser, anything I could get my hands on. The only thing I found were the keys that fell from my pocket, and they would have to work. I jabbed the keys into the side of the creature, angering it as I felt the grip on my neck tighten. The annoyance proved it\u2019s worth though, as it loosened its grip on my left arm so that it could pry the keys out of my right hand. Breaking free my left arm from its grip I was able to pull my gun and shoot directly into the chest of the demon. (I don\u2019t know if they are actual demons or not. That\u2019s just what it reminded me of.) \n\nThe thing went limp, but I heard scurrying heading my way. An inky blob jumped on my face while I was still on the ground and tried to ram itself down my throat. I was able to free my right arm and catch it before it slithered down. I slammed the thing into the ground over and over again until it stopped struggling. Finally, I was able to get up and recover my flashlight. I looked over the bodies, the blob was unrecognizable, I didn\u2019t know for sure if that was a result of my slamming it to death or if it was born that ugly. Edith, or whatever it was, left a puddle beneath their body the same shade as the black blood leaking from the blob. That\u2019s when I knew for sure the two were connected. \n\nI didn\u2019t have time to step outside before chaos erupted. Screams and slams filled the air. Looking all around I could see houses going dark, and then neighbors I\u2019d known for years would calmly emerge and walk towards the next lit house. Others were climbing the street lamps and smashing them out. A few had noticed my flashlight beam hit them and did not take kindly to it. They began to run my way and I looked around me for anyone else who was still sane. Jason\u2019s door had already been kicked in and I could hear no struggle. Ted, who lived on the other side of Edith, was busy smashing the lights on my patrol cruiser. I was alone in this. \n\nI quickly grabbed Edith\u2019s keys from under her demon\u2019s corpse and jumped in her car. I barely had time to lock the doors before the neighbors slammed themselves against the car. They punched and kicked furiously at the windows as I started the car, but their attention diverted to the headlights once I flicked the lights on. They hated light above all else. I slammed into reverse and drove over a couple of inky speed bumps before shifting into drive and flooring the gas. I made my best guess at the direction I came from, trying to get back to the police station and tell them what's going on. At this point I didn\u2019t know if it would make a difference. How did they multiply so fast? Edith tried to be subtle, but now they must have enough that they feel they can be blatant about their attack and there\u2019s nothing we can do. I guess in the end they were right about that assumption.\n\nOn my way back, a woman jumped in front of my car screaming for me to stop. Lilith, a punk rock style woman who, well, I\u2019ll let her introduce herself. She might not want to be depicted by the \u201cGoody two shoes cop\u201d as she calls me. Anyways, even though she was carrying a battle axe, she didn\u2019t try to bust out my headlights, so I unlocked the doors and let her in. There was no time to chat as I noticed she had pursuers and they were rapidly approaching us. I slammed on the gas again and drove us to the station. I parked blocking the station's doors with the car and Lilith and I scrambled to get inside. The station was dark, and I feared the worst until I heard Sherry shouting.\n\n\u201cWhat in the hell are you doing Gael?\u201d Sherry came storming down the steps to inspect the doors. \u201cWhat is the matter with you? Driving like a bat out of hell. That\u2019s not even your cruiser! Why are you driving Edith\u2019s car? This isn\u2019t a repair shop.\u201d\n\n\u201cSherrel shut the fuck up! Do you have no clue what\u2019s going on out there? People are being killed, or possessed, or replaced, or I don\u2019t fucking know. Bad shit is happening!\u201d Sherry was taken aback by my outburst. I had never yelled at her before.\n\n\u201cWhat is going on? What did you get into?\u201d Sherry wiped her finger on my shirt and examined the liquid.\n\n\u201cBlood of some sort, I think.\u201d I respond and Sherry frantically wipes her finger off on a clean part of my uniform.\n\n\u201cMs. Officer Sherry, there\u2019s something that came with the darkness. These little, like, black jelly things. They try to crawl into people, and when they get in they take over or they become a copy. The people they get start going after light, and anyone who is left in the light.\u201d Lilith backed me up.\n\n\u201cWe have to send out a warning!\u201d Sherry was about to run back upstairs when I caught her.\n\n\u201cIt might be too late. I don\u2019t think we can handle this without more people. Have you heard back from anyone outside of town yet?\u201d \n\n\u201cNot yet. Gabe just got back a bit ago. I overheard him ask Debbie to come help him look for some old maps.\u201d Sherry pointed towards the shut doors of Gabe\u2019s office. My blood ran ice cold as I came to a realization.\n\n\u201cIf you didn\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. Why did you turn the lights off down here?\u201d Sherry gives me a quizzical look. \n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t. I figured you two turned the lights off to keep attention away from us.\u201d I unholstered my gun and approached Gabe\u2019s office.\n\n\u201cGale?\u201d Sherry whispered but I cut her off. Slowly and cautiously I opened the door. My light scanned over the room until it fell upon Debbie\u2019s body lying upon Gabe\u2019s desk. Her eyes were wide with horror and black liquid oozed out of her mouth. A large puddle lay on the floor beneath her and as the light hit the puddle it began to take shape. In the span of a few seconds it had transformed from a puddle of black ooze to a perfect physical replica of Debbie. The creature turned our way but I shot it before it could make its move. \n\nRight after taking the shot I felt a linebacker level tackle knock me to the ground once again. Gabe stood over me growling as I tried to fight my way back to my feet. His body was much stronger than Edith\u2019s demon though, and he quickly had me pinned. I thought I was finished until I watched his head be split in two. He went limp and I was able to push him off as Lilith freed her axe from the demon's skull. Sherry turned the light on in the room and we were allowed to breathe a short sigh of relief as no other monsters were in with us. Our relief was short lived, as upon checking on Debbie it was clear she was truly dead.\n\n\u201cWhat happened to Shawn?\u201d I ask Sherry.\n\n\u201cWell, the calls stopped coming in all of a sudden, so he went to check on the phone lines.\u201d Sherry\u2019s tone dropped as unspoken understanding fell on all of us that Shawn was likely already gone as well. This was it. This is all that is left of us. Before any of us could ask what to do next, we heard knocking on the window of the front office.\n\n\u201cHey. I think I found what is wrong with the phones. Can someone come out here and help me fix them?\u201d Just like Edith, this demon had Shawn\u2019s voice but couldn\u2019t mimic his emotion. \n\n\u201cWhat do you see wrong out there Shawn?\u201d I played along. \n\n\u201cThe phone line is cut. It must have been an animal. I can fix it if someone comes out to help me. Come help.\u201d The replica continued knocking, just like Edith. Knock-knock-knock-knock.\n\n\u201cIs there something wrong with the front door bud?\u201d I kept trying to distract it as we crept back towards the stairway.\n\n\u201cIt won\u2019t open. I think someone locked it. Can you come and open it so we can fix the phone lines?\u201d We were almost up the stairs, but the stress in Lilith had been welled up for too long and it finally burst.\n\n\u201cOr it\u2019s because there\u2019s a fucking car in front of the door you stupid freak! You\u2019re a fake fucking freak and we all know it! Leave us the hell alone!\u201d Lilith\u2019s outburst stunned the demon. It ceased knocking, and for a second I thought her yelling had actually convinced it to give up and leave. Instead, the creature let out a guttural howl that could be heard reciprocated from all around. \n\nI slammed the door shut and began stacking desks against it as we heard glass shatter down below. We all backed away from the door as our barricade shook from the force of those things slamming themselves against the door. They slammed as hard as a battering ram, over and over, for so long that I was convinced the door would just shatter into splinters and they would come crawling through. After a few hours, they suddenly stopped, and all was silent for just a moment. Then the knocking returned. Knock-knock-knock-knock.\n\nMy name is Sherry, also a deputy in New Troy\u2019s Sheriff\u2019s Office. I read over what Gael has already written and I don\u2019t know how much to add. I don\u2019t exactly feel like talking about myself or my background. I\u2019m nothing special, just a girl good at solving things. I guess this is a bit too much for me to solve though.\n\nWhile Gael was gone I looked for more information to figure out what exactly was happening. That was all before I learned about the body snatchers but maybe something about the data here can help people understand what happened to us. I\u2019m hoping at the least it may present some warning signs to prevent this from happening anywhere else. If you want my professional opinion about what to do if you think a town is being taken over, I\u2019d probably suggest nuking it until nothing is left. \n\nWe don\u2019t have a clue how far this stretches, but considering the highway that runs through town I imagine if anyone could get in or out help would have come by now. I already know we had trouble reaching people remotely, I\u2019d be surprised if there wasn\u2019t a physical barrier as well. Geographically, as far as I can tell we have not moved. We haven\u2019t been transported to another dimension, we haven\u2019t entered some afterlife, we\u2019re simply held captive by\u2026 something. \n\nOn the day the Sun was taken, it was much like how Gael described. It was as if we were living in a cartoon day/night cycle, where there is no sunset or fading of light. It was just like the black wave consumed all the light in the sky over us. No stars, no moon, no sun. Even though we lack sunlight, the temperature hasn\u2019t shifted. The temperature still changes, but it\u2019s not hotter or cooler than before. We also follow a day/night cycle when it comes to temperature, even being devoid of sunlight. My computer still tracks the time, and when it says it is night the temperature is significantly cooler. When it is supposed to be morning we can feel the heat returning as if the sun was still rising with us. All of this leads me to believe we are trapped under whatever has taken us hostage. It\u2019s almost like it just threw a giant blanket over our heads.\n\nAs for the body snatchers, I don\u2019t know what to make of them. They obviously don\u2019t like light. Unless being directly threatened, they will make it their first priority to seek out and destroy light. That makes me wonder if our captor works to shield them or if they are even a part of the giant blanket in the sky. It seems odd that a creature that dislikes light would also use itself to shield smaller parts of it from life, so I think the two are separate. Maybe if we were able to cut open or even kill the giant blanket we would be able to beat these things. That\u2019s just a pipedream though. There\u2019s nothing in our town large enough to hurt that thing. We would need the military to have a hope. I fear us three have simply all run out of hope. \n\nWe lasted a good while though. I never thought I would appreciate the day that Sheriff Gabe made Gale and me haul all the emergency relief supplies upstairs for storage so that he could turn the storage closet into the \u201cSheriff's Office Arsenal\u201d. I\u2019m pretty sure if I could get down there now that room would still be empty. Gabe was such a goofball with visions of grandeur. I miss him. I miss Debbie, I wish I had been paying more attention that day. Maybe I could have saved her. I miss Shawn, I wish I went out with him to check on the lines. I wish so much that things had gone differently. I wish that I could have saved just one person.\n\nThat\u2019s the only reason why I agreed to write in this. I hope what little I was able to learn can help save someone in the future. If I even save one person that\u2019s enough. I just don\u2019t want to die without doing something. I don\u2019t want to die without a reason.\n\nWow, and here I thought I\u2019d be the doom and gloom of this little diary of Gaels. I\u2019m Lilith, the last survivor of what I have to imagine is one of the worst apocalypse scenarios in the tier list. I was hoping for something a little fun at least. Zombies, machine uprising, hell I would have even settled for nuclear fallout. I guess it at least beats climate change. \n\nI\u2019m going to take a time out to redeem Ms. Sherry for a second here. She\u2019s being too hard on herself and she can\u2019t tell me no, so let's get her backstory first. Sherry is your typical go-getter. She was blessed with good looks and a functioning brain, which made her homecoming queen every year in high school and prom queen of course. She was also Valedictorian, which I know our graduating class wasn\u2019t the largest but is still an impressive achievement. She was born to do great things, which I think is why she\u2019s so down right now. It\u2019s fair enough though, she didn\u2019t deserve this. I mean, none of us deserved this I would say, but she especially didn\u2019t deserve this.\n\nAs for myself, thank you so much for asking, I was the opposite of Sherry. I\u2019m not in the prep group, I was the goth girl who was SO above that and I gave Sherry a lot of shit growing up. I myself, was a little shit I will admit, and while I haven\u2019t grown out of my \u201crebellious phase\u201d I have grown. Getting to know Sherry now makes me wish I hadn\u2019t been so hostile to her all this time. Who would have thought she was a total softie?\n\nGetting on with the point, I watched firsthand as those jello sludge blobs took my family from me. I was in my room, playing a game that is unnecessary to title, when the blackness swallowed the sky. At first I thought it was pretty cool but it quickly lost its luster when things started going sideways. I could hear knocking on the door and it was irritating as I tried to play so I yelled down to my dad to go answer it. I heard the door open and shut and I got back to playing. About 20 minutes had passed since the knock and I was curious who had bothered us. I went downstairs to try and find my mom but she had left the house too. Being alone in the house, in the pitch black, kind of put me on edge. I decided in case anyone wanted to try and break in to go grab my axe. I got a replica of the axe Kratos uses in the new God of War. Damn. That sequel was supposed to come out soon too. Why couldn\u2019t this shit happen after I got to play that?\n\nAnyways, thoroughly creeped out but feeling a little better with my axe, I went to go look for my mom and dad. The streets did not help with the creepy feeling. They were completely empty, absolutely quiet, not a soul in sight. I shouted down the street for them only for them to call me from the neighbors house across the road. I asked what was taking them so long and they just told me to come inside. The house was pitch black inside and so I wasn\u2019t going in there for a million bucks. I tried to tell my dad that when my mom chimed in.\n\n\u201cWe got you a puppy darling. Please, come in so you can see it!\u201d My mother spoke in a sing-songy voice which she wouldn\u2019t be caught dead using. Red flag #1. She was my role model and I was her mini-me. We were two punks through-and-through and we were way too close to need to pretend to be otherwise with each other. Red flag #2, who buys their 24 year old daughter a puppy without even mentioning it or talking about it first? \n\n\u201cMom. Why don\u2019t you and dad bring it over to our house instead?\u201d\n\n\u201cSweetie, don\u2019t be difficult and get over here now.\u201d My dad insisted and so stupidly I complied.\n\nI got up to the porch before my better judgment got a hold again. I couldn\u2019t see inside at all. Things were just too weird. I began to call for my parents again when my dad came lunging out the door at me. I jumped back but he managed to grab my ankle and I could hear my mom and the neighbor running for me as well. I held the axe up and looked down at my dad. I didn\u2019t know it wasn\u2019t him, so I couldn\u2019t bring myself to hurt him. Despite popular belief, I loved my parents. They had always done their best in raising me and even when we would disagree we would sit down and talk things out. They never so much as spanked me. If it was a zombie apocalypse the answer would have been clear, there\u2019s no coming back, aim for the head. I didn\u2019t expect that when I was in a life or death situation with my dad he would still look normal. Just acting weird didn\u2019t mean he was gone for good. I slipped my shoe off instead and retreated back towards the street. Looking around I saw more people leaving their houses, eyes fixed on me. They were threatening to encircle me, so I did the only thing I could. \n\nI ran, hopping over fences and twisting and turning just like the time when I was 16 and Officer Dandy pulled me over. I had a couple grams of weed on me and so I panicked and bolted. Never ran so fast in my life until now. I guess I should give Gael a break about that too. He was pretty cool with me when he caught me. He didn\u2019t charge me with anything, he said he just wanted to let me know my tail lights were out and to get the bulbs changed. He did take my weed though and that pissed me off. Unlike on that night, I couldn\u2019t have been more glad to see him when I saw the car speeding down the road. I wasn\u2019t the most thrilled seeing Gael was the driver, but when I thought about it at least I knew he wasn\u2019t going to hurt me. In the end he really does have a heart of gold despite being a cop.\n\nAll things said, I\u2019m glad we had our time together. Even with it being just us three, we had some good times. Never before would I have ever guessed I\u2019d say being locked in with two cops would be a good time, but I guess the apocalypse really does change you. I really love these two now. I don\u2019t think I would have made it this long with any other duo. I never really cared before, but now I hope there is an afterlife. I hope it treats Sherry and Gael well, and if I\u2019m lucky I\u2019ll get to be there with them.\n\nThis is the end for us though, we would rather go on our own terms than become one of those things. With us gone, you can forget about New Troy. You must leave it undisturbed forever.\n\nWe three swear that what we have documented here is true. We leave you with our final thoughts, and one final warning. Do not try to save New Troy, UT. Whatever is left inside, it is not us.

"personalfinance,Psychosist,My mom is trying to increase my rent from $1000/mo to $5000, unsure what to do,I'm a recent college graduate in the Bay Area currently making $118k on a contract role that ends later this year and my mom has been a bit obsessed with my finances since I started working full-time. After taxes and my 15% 401k contribution I take home \\~$6300 monthly. I'm currently investing 3k monthly into index funds and putting aside $500 monthly into savings and paying $250 monthly for student loans.\n\nI'm living with my mom at the moment and paying $1000 monthly in rent because my mom wants to be able to pay off her mortgage and retire early in \\~10 years and would have a hard time doing that without my current help. She's still short $180k at 2.75% on the mortgage with about 26.5 years left on the term. I believe she's putting in \\~1800 a month of her money into the house for mortgage + insurance + fees and with my 1000 contribution that's about $2800 monthly which should pay off the mortgage in just under 10 years (she will be 62 then). \n\nMy current issue is that she recently asked if I would be willing to increase my rent from 1k monthly to 5k monthly which would speed up the mortgage payoff date to just under 3 years from now. I argued that I wouldn't really be able to save up for a house if I paid 5k monthly during those 3 years but she argued that \"the house would be both of ours once paid off\" and that if I really needed money to move out after those 3 years she could take out a loan against the house equity to use for my future down payment. I don't love living at home at the moment (but I don't hate it either -- I don't pay for groceries or cook) and I'm iffy about my job security, my pay consistency once my contract ends, and whether or not I'll be \"behind\" on saving if I pay 5k in rent. I want to move out within \\~8-10 years for sure but sooner is better. Ideally I'd be able to afford a house by that time (maybe a 1-2 bedroom condo/townhouse in the Bay Area) but a lot of things are up in the air and I can be flexible. Any tips?

"personalfinance,heels888a,Paying off properties vs investing,My partner and I are in our late 20's DINK and make about 200k before taxes. No debt, have very little expenses, have new cars and do not want kids. Unfortunately very behind on investing for retirement - I have 1k while my partner has about 10k in a 401k. We have two rental properties. 50k in emergency fund/savings.\n\nProperty 1 has 230k left on 30 yr mortgage at 3.5% interest rate . Currently rented for 2150.\n\nProperty 2 has 250k left on 30 yr mortgage at 3.7% interest rate . Currently rented for 2400.\n\nAfter paying the mortgages and all expenses, we save about $6500 a month if we do not put anything into retirement. \nIf we put an additional $3k a month into a property, we can pay it off within 5-6 years. If we pay $5k extra into a property, we can pay it off within about 3.5 years. If we invest $5k a month for 5 years with return of 6% then we'll have about $350k. \n\nI was thinking of making $3k extra mortgage payment a month into one of the properties and then investing $3k/month while my partner wants to just pour everything into paying off the mortgages while contributing the min to get employee's match which is about 3% of our salaries.

"atheism,eth_trader_12,Does Bayesianism account for simplicity?,Assume you have two hypotheses with the exact same prior probability and the exact same probability of the evidence occurring for each hypothesis. For those unaware, Bayesianism basically as a rough summary says the probability of a certain hypothesis given data should be equal to the ratio of its prior probability and the probability that the evidence would occur given the hypothesis. \n\nSay the evidence you observe is an apple falling from a tree. Assume from this example that you don\u2019t know anything about the world. \n\nHypotheses A: Multiple demons are all working together to shake the tree and drop the apple\n\nHypotheses B: Wind shook the tree and dropped the apple \n\nAssume we live in a world where we observe A and B at about the exact same frequencies. Perhaps we learn about A through directly witnessing devils do it and learn about B directly through witnessing the wind do it. Assume that these are the only two known hypotheses and that in both cases, the apple always falls in the same way at the same place. Perhaps to make it simpler, assume one apple tree was all that ever existed. \n\nBayesianism says that after observing an apple on the ground, and given that these are the only two know theories (hence the only ones with positive priors that aren\u2019t infinitesimally low), there is no reason to prefer one over the other, given the likelihood of the evidence given each theory is also the same. \n\nYet clearly, say by understanding more in depth the complexity of how the process of wind works vs demons, it doesn\u2019t seem intuitive to posit that they\u2019re equally likely. One (I.e. the wind) seems to have less assumptions needed to make to explain it happening rather than the demons. How does one solve this?\n\nTo me, it seems that simplicity is irrelevant for theories that have established priors, but that it is relevant for theories with no historically confirmed occurrences in the past. But then in that case, wouldn\u2019t Bayesianism then account for a theory with no previous occurrence by simply giving more complex theories a lower prior? Does this address your allegation that Bayesianism doesn\u2019t deal with simplicity? \n\nFor example, a divine being with attributes X and Y is probably (or is it necessarily) less likely than a divine being with attributes X and Y and Z, and thus the former would be given a smaller prior. Or do you think this is still subjective in that we are apriori assuming that a being with more attributes is less likely? It goes back to the \u201cJane is a farmer\u201d and \u201cJane is a farmer who likes to smoke weed\u201d example. Is it a logically necessary fact that the second must have lower epistemic probability or is there some other hidden assumption here?,https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/v4zrpp/does_bayesianism_account_for_simplicity/,False"

"TwoXChromosomes,2001exmuslim,Me (20F) and my coworker (F22) became friends and I regret it--how to back out?,My (F20) and my friend (22F) (I'll just call her Layla) met last August at our university student job. At the time when we met at the gym my boss changed my shifts to closing at 10pm, and she also worked closing so offered to drive me home. I accepted the offer but was wary because I didn't want this to end up with a new friendship. I know that sounds horrible but I didn't really want to make friends at the time because I was stressed with everything and there was something about her vibe that made me more distanced. \n\nAfter a while, my other work friend (who I knew and got close with before Layla) started inviting Layla to our outings. I couldn't just say no so it ended up with all three of us hanging out a lot. A few months later, there was drama in our friend group with Layla, another coworker (\"Maria\") who hung out with us, and my other friend. Layla and Maria would borderline talk shit about my friend, making insensitive comments about her depression and asking my friend's friend (who also worked with us--a lot of us at this job knew one another prior) why she acts a certain way. I didn't like this and  my friend found out and basically broke down, so I began to distance myself from them.  \n\nAt this point Layla made a group chat with her, myself, and Maria. It felt so awkward because everything just felt so forced. I never really made invitations to things, it was her, but I felt bad saying no because she was the one who drove me home almost all semester last Fall. In the group chat, she constantly asks to hang out and I feel so horrible saying no. One time I had to run errands with my mom and I actually wanted to because I hadn't seen my mom a lot because of her job. Layla asked in the group chat if we could all hang out that day and I said I couldn't because I'm with my mom and wanted to chill that day. She insisted she would wait for me, but I said I genuinely couldn't. She kept pushing me to say yes until Maria had to step in and say it was okay if I didn't come. I know I sound anti-social but I tend to get overwhelmed when I see friends too much. I love hanging out, but if I see someone almost everyday of the week I need to recharge and just spend time with myself. I told Layla about my needing to recharge after a while but she disregarded it and continues to constantly ask to hang out. Idk, I feel stuck in this friendship.  I never agreed to it, but it is partially my own fault for agreeing to go out in the beginning. Things aren't like this with my few other friends, we see each other enough where we don't get tired of one another. I never feel forced or obligated to hang out with them because we give each other space when needed. Recently I've told her I can walk/take the bus home and she got really offended, saying \"do you not like me or something?\". I told her that wasn't the case, that I enjoy the walk home because I can clear my head and plus I like being able to listen to music on my commute home (I didn't say the last part).\n\nShe's also really invalidating and kind of mean to me lol. I'm not the type of person to always share how I feel if something's hurting me especially with someone I'm not close with but when I do, I feel like she's judging me. Just her words don't feel supportive and she's always talking in a rude tone to me. Idek why she insists on hanging out so much when we literally clash so much. She made me feel guilty for hooking up once with a guy and she shamed me for not telling my mom if I'm dating or not (my mom is super religious and doesn't want me to date guys, if she found out I'd probably be disowned). And I recently started dating a guy and whenever I bring up an anecdote about us her face/demeanor changes and her responses are pretty dry and dismissive. She offered to drive me to my boyfriend's home once and when she got lost, got angry at me and made me feel bad, even though I insisted it was okay for her to not take me.\n\nOur relationship doesn't feel like a true one at all. I started hanging out with her because I felt obliged and I know that's incredibly cowardly of me but I didn't know saying no was an option at the time. I'm guessing she's lonely and feels the need to be around people a lot(she doesn't have many other friends--nether do I though lol, not trying to be shady about that).  Now I'm stuck in a friendship I don't want to be in.

Like when greeting a population, I should say \"hello everyone\" over \"hey guys\". The counter argument was that by addressing people as everyone isn't there an opportunity to say that that doesn't include everyone  in theory - as in someone could say they are offended by that as much as someone says they are offended by hey guys (maybe not even offended, but rather are excluded by).\n\nI was a little stumped for a response and idk if there's a good response to it other than I want to, in general be as responsive and learning.

"tifu,AssociationAlone1177,tifu by almost accidently drowning,Let me start by saying this wasn't my brightest moment nor was I in the environment for this to normally happen. I was sitting there, in the natural habitat of my living room just chillin. There I was jamming master of puppets on my guitar enjoying my saturday smoking a little reefer. After playing a bit I decided it was break time. This is where my inner stoner comes out and almost kills me.\n\nI go grab my bong and pack myself a decent hit and rip that sucker. Idk if you've ever tasted bong water or had the misfortune to even smell it, but it's the last thing you want to start choking on (hehe). I had a good cough, gather myself, and think ok I'm fine but what if there's a chance some is still in my lungs well that can't be good (classic paranoia). I grab a glass of water and attempt to \"flush my lungs\", thinking \" If I breathe just a sip in it should just cause me to cough again\". That was not the case.\n\nI Inhale not thinking twice and the water disappears. I go to cough only I can't. The water was stuck. I went to breathe and felt like there was an immense pressure was on my chest and I could only take small shallow breaths before the backpressure stopped my inhale. My breaths were getting shorter. I felt myself starting to get lightheaded. I panicked. The only thing I could think was run outside so hopefully somebody finds me before it's too late. I lunge off my couch and stumble for the door. This action is what caused my lungs to open up just enough for me to finally breathe. I retched. Sweet oxygen.\n\nMy dog gave me a concerned look and I just took a moment to reflect on how I just survived my own simulated drowning. This shook me up ngl. Figured I'd share considering it's the most dramatic sip of water if ever had. Lesson learned gotta keep a clean bong and don't overfill.

"Jokes,Zarf-Raz,Annual Golf Trip,     A gentleman is on his annual holiday in Scotland where he loves to get in a few rounds of golf. He tees off at the 10th hole and his ball slices terribly. When he finds his ball he notices a leprechaun lying next to his ball, out cold, with a goose egg on his forehead. Concerned for the little fellow he picks him up and is able to rouse him. The leprechaun comes to his senses and sees that he is well and truly caught. He tells the fellow, \"well lad, this is not how things ususally go but ye caught me nonetheless, and so, well, I've got to grant ye three wishes.\" The man smiles and says well, I'm just relieved you're ok but I suppose I could use a few wishes. \n     He thinks for a moment and says \"I wish my golf game would be a lot better\". \"Done!\" says the leprechaun.  \"And for your second wish?\" The man thinks and then admits that he really could use some more money to take care of his needs. So, he says \"I wish for that, plenty of money to have on hand wheneverI need. \"No problem\" comes the reply. \"And for your last wish?\" The man considers for a moment and finally says, somewhat furtively, \"well, I'm a bit uneasy around the ladies so I wish I had a more robust love life\" \"Aye lad, that will be no problem\" says the little man in green. With that the two part ways. \n     The next year the gentleman once again goes on holiday and is teeing off at the 10th hole of his favorite course. His ball slices, which causes his eyebrow to raise. Then he approaches his ball it becomes clear what has happened. He finds the same leprechaun sitting on a small tree stump just off fairway at the edge of the rough. \"Hallo there lad, that was quite a shot!\" The man notices that the ball must have struck that stump and bounced into the fairway with a prefect approach to the green. \"Well thank you fine sir, it seems my luck is holding. I've shot better than par since that day we last met. I suppose my wish had something to do with that\". The leprechaun smiles a wide grin and nods, then says. \"How is your money holding up\"? The man replies \"well, whenever I go to buy anything, I reach into my pocket and always pull out as much as I need, thank you for that\". The leprechaun says \"well, that's all just part of the rules of the wish game but I am happy that you're satisfied\". Then he asks the man \"How is your sex life holding up\"? The man glances around, blushes a bit and says \"well, I typically bed a lass a few times a month\". At this the leprechaun scoffs and replies \"good sir! I would think you could do much better than that! You made a clear wish after all\". \n    To this the man replies, somewhat indignantly, \"well now,  I'd say that's not too bad for a priest in a small parrish!\",https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/v4zz7v/annual_golf_trip/,False"

"television,Kazrules,Netflix's volume method is the worst of both worlds,I'm enjoying the new season of Stranger Things but I really hate Netflix's volume method that they have done for their shows. It seems like they want to have their cake and eat it too, but ultimately it ends up disgruntling both sides of the binge/weekly debate. \n\nFor shows like Sabrina, Cuphead, Stranger Things, and Jojo, Netflix has opted to break the full seasons in half and release them in batches. I feel like this is a poor idea and just generates confusion. I have spoken to so many people who are fully expecting seven more episodes of Stranger Things in volume two.\n\nI hate the volume releases because it ruins the momentum of the season. Jojo's release was absolutely abhorrent, because the fans are already used to a weekly release. Discussion and hype was minced into fragments, and the fans weren't on the same page. Obi-Wan's third episode, as much as I disliked it, had so much effect because the fans got to witness it at the same time.\n\nI think the weekly release would have really benefited Stranger Things. The episodes are very long and each one has enough content to sit with until the following week. Summer break also lends itself to a lot more hype and discussion because the targeted demographic has a lot more free time. I also think releasing three episodes + weekly, like the Boys, could also be a good method. \n\nI really hope Netflix ditches this model and just committed to either weekly or binge.,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/v5002d/netflixs_volume_method_is_the_worst_of_both_worlds/,False"

"nosleep,Rick_the_Intern,Someone planted a garden in my backyard without my knowledge.,Both my husband and I had been caught up in work projects for the past months. So when our daughter came to me about a garden in the backyard, I knew it couldn\u2019t have been him. \n\nThere had been some tension in our marriage, separate rooms and spaces as we worked from home and avoided our issues. It was easier for me to go straight outside, without a word to him, and have a look at this so-called garden myself. Because our daughter is nine, my first impulse was imagining what her mind might produce or overexaggerate. Maybe, I reasoned to myself, she had tried planting seeds or relocating shrubs. \n\nOnce I stepped out onto our back porch, though, it became apparent that there was a sizable chunk of growth back there. I inched down the patio stairs. I first glanced under the porch, holding my breath and my cell tight. \n\nNo one was under the porch.\n\nAs for the supposed garden, it was blocked off with hedges. There was an entrance.  The entrance was circular, made of bent branches and twigs. Vines and mosses twined around and hung from it.\n\nI could not see far. Not without entering. As the threshold was only a little above waist height, I would have to get down on my hands and knees to gain access. I did go around the \u201cgarden\u201d first, to get an idea of its scope, but because it backed up against our fence and seemed to stretch beyond that, down into the woods, I couldn\u2019t get a real sense of its extent. \n\nWhat made it impossible to see inside was the thick hedging. It was wild and layered, and it wound over the top. I wasn\u2019t for sure that there *was* a garden in there. \n\nI did not go in, not then anyway. I went back inside our house and questioned Sadie about it. \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know when I first saw it,\u201d she said. \u201cCoulda been . . . last week. Think it was a surprise?\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom whom?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019s from those inside?\u201d\n\nA chill planted its fingers on my spine and walked its way down on weird hands. \u201cWho is inside Sadie?\u201d\n\nAlthough she smiled, she seemed more than a little frightened.\n\nWhen I asked again, her only reply was \u201cI dunno.\u201d \n\nI questioned Michael, my husband, about it, and I asked our neighbors. \n\nNobody knew how the garden, if garden it was, had gotten there. \n\nI called the police. They sent over a couple of officers who went in on hands and knees while assuring me they could draw their weapons from that position. It was just me and Sadie standing there near the garden entrance. \n\nMy husband was in the house supposedly up to his neck in work. \n\nAbout an hour passed. \n\nOur backyard is not very big; the garden couldn\u2019t have taken up more than a quarter of it. When fear got the better of embarrassment, I started yelling out for the officers.\n\nSadie was really quiet beside me. I expected all kinds of questions. *Something* in there had spooked her. She kept looking from me to the entrance.\n\nThe moss quivered about the entryway like a breath was coming out. I began to imagine shadows creeping at the mouth. \n\nWhen I could just see a crawling shape that turned its way into the opening, that crawled in a hurry towards us, I put my arms around Sadie and got ready to run. \n\n\u201cHey!\u201d one of the officers called out. \u201cIt\u2019s just us.\u201d\n\nThey told us about what they had seen. Like a maze, they said, and pretty, but not well kept. Strange as sin to boot. Their pants knees were stained and somewhat ripped. I wondered if they\u2019d crawled the entire way. \n\n\u201cNot well-kept?\u201d I was most incredulous about that. \u201cIt just got here.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope you aren\u2019t yanking our chains,\u201d the older officer said. He was stretching his back. \u201cThis garden has to have been here for years. It goes back into the woods, too. For a long ways. My partner and I . . . we didn\u2019t see the end of it. When you\u2019d move in?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a little over a year now,\u201d I said. \n\n\u201cThink you could\u2019ve missed it?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot a chance in hell. But you didn\u2019t see anyone in there, did you?\u201d\n\n\u201cNope. We\u2019re pretty sure its empty. We would\u2019ve heard somebody at the very least, or found the usual signs. You could have some deer or other animals living out of it from time to time, though. Pretty neat.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty unsettling is what it is,\u201d I said. \u201cI have no idea how that got here. Can\u2019t you do anything about it?\u201d\n\nThe older officer shrugged. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s your property,\u201d the younger one said. \u201cAt least what\u2019s *on* your property. Happen to know whose is behind yours?\u201d\n\nI couldn\u2019t remember. \n\nThey told me to give them a call if we did see anyone trying to take up residence there. When I told them it was my daughter who implied there might be someone within, they nodded and smiled knowingly. And soon they were on their way.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\n\nI was sure someone had to have planted it, and recently. There was no way I could\u2019ve missed a thing like that. And Michael, he had been so thorough about our property before we moved in, surveying every square inch.  \n\nI had to see the inside of that so-called garden myself. I told Michael that I was going in. I told him that if he didn\u2019t hear back from me in a couple of hours, he was to call my cell. His door was closed and he had that folk music of his turned up loud, but I was sure he could hear me because I got the usual\u2014what had become usual\u2014grunt back.\n\n\u201cAnd if you aren\u2019t able to get a hold of me,\u201d I said, \u201ccall the police. For Sadie\u2019s sake.\u201d\n\nAnother stifled grunt from him, and then I was heading downstairs. I told Sadie to stay inside and if I wasn\u2019t back by dinner to go up and knock on Daddy\u2019s door and remind him to call me.  \n\nSadie wanted to go too. I had to promise her some new toys if she remained on the living room couch watching her favorite programs until I got back. \n\nI didn\u2019t have any pepper spray or anything, and I didn\u2019t want to be crawling with a knife, so I took along a bottle of hairspray and a lighter. It\u2019s not that I really planned on using them, considering the untold damage a big fire could do to habitat and home. It was mainly just to make me feel safe.\n\nBut I *did not* feel safe as I got down on my hands and knees in the backyard and finally crawled into the entrance of that garden. \n\nIf I half-closed my eyes, it might seem like I was clambering though one of those playhouse tunnels at fast food restaurants. But the light that seeped through the strangled vegetation, it infused flowers, highlighting them. Many different kinds were entangled. There were also herbs growing, and I smelled about a hundred scents strangling each other as I crawled. If this thing was a garden, it was avant-garde. Maybe not new from the looks of it, but certainly experimental. In my mind, I started calling it \u201cavant gard-en\u201d for some good ole self-levity. I don\u2019t know how whoever planted it kept those species from taking each other\u2019s light, space, and nutrients, how they didn\u2019t all kill each other in that embrace. \n\nIt was crawl all the way, and there were many forks. I just kept taking right turns so as not to lose track. I was planning to at some point map out the whole thing, if it was possible. Maybe, once I was out again, I\u2019d start by figuring out what expert I needed to call out to truly investigate the garden. \n\nAfter about an hour and a half or so, I began to hear this music. It started with a few grunts. Then there was like a whistling, not like from human lips but more as if it were a breeze flowing over some open bottles. It scared the life out of me. But I had to find the source of it. I had to put all my fears to bed if I could. Otherwise, I\u2019d be tempted just to burn them to the ground.\n\nI kept looking behind me, then in front. So much so that I was losing time. Michael would call my cell, and then I\u2019d go back. *But what if he didn\u2019t?* I wondered.\n\nIt had been afternoon when I crawled in. What if it got truly dark?\n\nWith those fears offsetting the others, I picked up my pace, crawling ever closer to that strange music. \n\nThen there was an opening. I started to stand up and scraped my head against a thorny ceiling. A yelp came out before I could stop it.  \n\nUp ahead, there was a rustle. The music had at some point quit playing.  \n\nI aimed my cellphone that way. \n\nThere were four garden gnomes, about the height of my shins, standing in a circle. One of them was facing me.\n\nI tried to pluck up my courage.\n\n\u201cIs this going to be one of those things,\u201d I said, \u201cwhere I look away, and you move, but when I stare at you again, you stay put?\u201d I said this laughing, but my voice cracked like the surfaces of those gnomes were.\n\nIn the head of the gnome that was facing me, there was a jagged hole in the upper right. Something winked in that darkness, an object pale and oily that recalled a pet hermit crab I had when I was a kid. Ants had gotten to it and had revealed to me that there was *another* hermit crab within. \n\n\u201cWell, let\u2019s give it a try,\u201d I said. \n\nMy heart ran in jagged lines away from my chest. I forced myself to look away from the gnomes. I kept remembering I had to put to bed all my fears. My family depended on it. I held my breath and waited until I saw stars. \n\nWhen I turned my head back around and looked again, with my cellphone held out like a weapon, something was crawling out of the gnome\u2019s cracked face. \n\nI screamed, backing into the garden tunnel I\u2019d come from in reverse.\n\nIt was a mistake, but I had to watch what was coming after me. \n\nIt gooped as much as crawled out. It was something like a pale, naked, deboned man. It must\u2019ve had to contort itself to fit into that garden gnome.\n\nIt slipped and squirmed along the ground, leaving a trail of goop behind. Its head was bald, its eyes crazed. \n\nI fumbled with my cellphone as I tried to scoot back on my rear at the same time. Doing both made me drop the phone. \n\nI screamed as it wriggled over my shoes. Digging in my pockets, I produced the lighter and hairspray bottle. \n\n\u201cBack off!\u201d I yelled.  \n\nI felt its weight, hard and slimy, pressing against my body as it explored towards my face. Its mouth salivated, as toothless as a baby\u2019s. I noticed a single hair jutting from its right ear.\n\nI put hairspray and fire together. A jet bloomed out and scorched its face. \n\nWhen it screamed, it was more like a man than an infant. \n\nFire caught on the surrounding vegetation, quickly spreading. \n\nI turned around, and I crawled, making lefts all the way. The fire must\u2019ve spread in another direction. Otherwise, I might\u2019ve have died in there. \n\nThe screaming I heard behind me was pretty bad; it mingled with the whistling I\u2019d heard before, creating a new song. \n\nUntil fire and smoke choked it all out. \n\nI ran into my house. Sadie was sitting there on the couch watching TV. I got on the landline. The fire department were soon on their way. \n\nI went slowly upstairs. Something about those grunts I\u2019d heard in the garden, before the strange music, wasn\u2019t sitting right with me. \n\nMichael\u2019s door was still closed, *his* folk music belting out like a concert was going on in his room. I noticed there was a lot of whistling to that particular song. I knocked. And knocked. \n\nThen I opened the door. \n\n\u201cMichael?\u201d I said.  \n\nHe was sitting at his desk, papers stacked all around. His head was tilted back in his chair and there was a hole at the top. An eye winked out at me. \n\nI shut his door, fumbled for the key above the frame, and locked it. I shoved a towel under the door and, with Sadie\u2019s help, slid a bookcase from my room up against it. \n\nSadie is still crying, but I can\u2019t explain anything to her. \n\nI\u2019m less afraid that it will unlock the door from the inside, more that it will slip through a crack. \n\nI don\u2019t know how that garden got there in the backyard. If it wasn\u2019t planted, if it didn\u2019t grow and age in a hurry, maybe it\u2019s some development or other from the woods that\u2019s crept out onto our property. But now it\u2019s all burning. I can hear the sirens of fire trucks as I\u2019m finishing up this post, playing countermelody to the whistling folk music that streams out, barely stifled, from Michael\u2019s bedroom. \n\n[R](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rick_the_Intern/)\n\n[OD](https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/),https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/v50539/someone_planted_a_garden_in_my_backyard_without/,False"

"tifu,AceofSpadesYT,TIFU by ruining my slow cooker and nearly causing a fire,Actually happened today.\n\nOver the past few months, I have been eating a lot of pork. Pork shoulders are fairly cheap and all you need to do is pop them in a slow cooker, add some veggies and broth, and cook on low for about 9 or 10 hours. Slow cookers are usually fairly safe; so people often leave them on through the day and have a nice meal when they come home from work. Today was different...\n\nLast time I used it, some broth had spilled on it so I cleaned the mechanical part (just the top of it away from the electric parts). So I brought it out again this morning and did the procedure. When I turned it on, I noticed some steam coming from the bottom; however, I assumed it was just heating up some water that was on the stove. So I left it and went to work. \n\nAbout four hours into my shift, my neighbor starts frantically calling me. She had called 12 times and sent 8 text messages (I heard nothing as I keep my phone on silent at work). I called her as soon as I saw the notifications and she explained what happened. Apparently, it had almost started an electrical fire. Luckily, she and her friend caught it just in time before it got out of hand. \n\nThe fire department was not called, and no one was hurt. So I am very grateful for that. But now I am without a slow cooker and a pork shoulder. Guess I owe my neighbors big time (I live in an apartment building).\n\nTL;DR: thought my slow cooker was boiling off spilled water; nearly caused a bunch of people to become homeless due to poor judgement,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/v505rk/tifu_by_ruining_my_slow_cooker_and_nearly_causing/,False"

I have 5 cards with balances totaling about $10,000 (listed below, I rounded them up but CK says I have $10k), and one of them just closed on me (haven't made purchases on it for over 8 months and I was $600 past due and it's not in collections yet), leaving me with 4 open accounts. The past due amount will be gone come the 15th of this month.\n\nAfter getting the closed account under control, should I be devoting my budget to paying that account off? Or should I stick to the minimum payments and go with the \"debt snowball\" method by focusing on my smaller balances first?\n\nSide question, if this closed card doesn't end up going to collections, how badly will this affect my chances of getting a home loan? I was thinking about going conventional but not with my credit score the way it is.\n\nThanks in advance.,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/v50o08/credit_card_closed_should_i_be_focusing_on_paying/,False"

Ultimately, it is a story of good vs evil with supernatural/religious themes and a moral of \"weapons are bad\".\n\nI was impressed with the character development and how many different personality types were represented. The wishful thinker, the brooding incel, the blue-collar worker, the philosopher, the narcissist, the reluctant leader and the apprehensive follower; almost anyone who reads this book can relate to one or more of the characters. The world-building was equally good, and the length of the uncut edition thoroughly conveyed the length of their journey.\n\nSome people don't like the ending because they think it fizzles out, but I see it as life simply moving on. Once the bad guy has been defeated and civilization starts making a comeback, what more is there to tell?\n\nI've been a fan of Stephen King for most of my life and have always heard how good *The Stand* is, but I put it off for years due to it being much longer than my attention span used to be.

I'm relatively slim/athletic but I've had tons of cellulite since I was probably 12 years old (I'm in my 30s now). It's genetic and not going away no matter how much I work out. And yes, it is a \\*lot\\* of very noticeable cellulite. Like, I don't think I've ever seen someone my size with as much as I have. Of course, like anyone else I have other \"flaws\" on my body like stretch marks, etc. but none of those things bother me at all compared to my dimply thighs.\n\nI know that none of my true friends would say anything about it or care, but that fact doesn't stop me from being paranoid about the idea that someone would comment on my thighs at the beach in a \"joking\" manner, because unfortunately those assholes do exist.

"personalfinance,Joe_Henge,Car refi / new credit card,Hello there folks! Just dipping my toes into this sub and could use some quick advice.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm in my late 20s, credit score in the low 700s. I have one credit card, a secured one I got a few years ago that has helped me turn my credit situation around immensely (along with better overall financial choices). I've been recently planning on refinancing my car loan, as my credit situation was *horrendous* when I stupidly bought the thing and so my interest on that loan is something ridiculous like 18% (I ended up getting a large salary increase at a new job and have been able to pay the monthly payments with no problem). \n\nI've also been thinking it might be time to look into getting a new credit card to help long term with # of accounts and such. I've been looking around at some of the cash back things I may qualify for (Am Ex Blue Cash maybe).\n\nJust looking for some thoughts on order/pace of how to move forward. I'm guessing getting my interest rate on the car down is priority #1, but should I also wait some time after doing that to send out any applications for a credit card? I'm not sure how big a deal it would be to have multiple hard pulls (at the moment, there's no hard pulls on my credit report) within a short time span if they're for different things?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAny advice is appreciated :),https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/v50x8o/car_refi_new_credit_card/,False"

"nosleep,Jensen_Reouge,My Grandpa Left Me Some Notes Pt2,I jolt up out of bed and check the time. Its 12:17(12:17pm). Nothing seems to be out of place. I slowly start to remember the events of last night. The figure, the notes, the texts-.\n\nI hastily grab my phone to check for the messages. The messages are still there. So, what happened last night DID happen? I ponder on that thought for a while. I see the shoe box on the desk. I toss off the covers and open the shoe box. I grab the top pages. They are blank? How did that happen? I grab my phone off the bed and text the unknown number.\n\n\"Who are you?\"\n\nI put my phone down, not expecting this person to text me back. I grab the next two pages out of the shoebox. still the same as how I left them. \n\nI start to get the feeling that something is watching me. I swing around and see the closet. I slowly walk towards it and open the door. Nothing is inside. it's completely empty. I ignore the previous night and continue on with my day. Eating, washing up, doing chores. As I was doing those things some strange things happened. Seeing shadows, hearing whispers, things moving. Nothing I'm not used to. \n\nBy the time I get back to my phone I have one new message from the strange number. \n\n\"you know me.\"\n\nI don't know any people. I have no friends, most of my family is dead. I purposefully changed my number so I could leave my past behind. I decide to read another page from the notes. Forgetting about what happened last night. I walk over to the shoebox and grab the next roll. This roll is two pages long, it reads:\n\n\"Have you ever thought about what lies under your bed? Some people believe in the, Boogie Man. Some people think that he's under your bed but that's a highly unlikely chance because there is only one of them. There are billions of children that he could scare. So why would he choose you?\n\nSo if he would not bother you, what else could want you? A monster, a ghost? Who knows. It may be a monster, they are real after all...\n\nWhat are the chances of it being a human down there? You know, under the bed? You are more likely to be killed the day it crawls under the bed. Maybe they might play with you a little. Grab at the toes or ankles. Tug your sheets. Then kill you. \n\nThey might pop out to eat your birthday cake at night. Maybe if they are nice clean your room and do the laundry.  But monsters, ghosts, people don't only live under children's beds. they live under every. Single. Persons. Bed. \n\nThe moment you are born they go under the thing you sleep in the first time. It doesn't matter. bed, couch, crib. It doesn't matter. The moment you sleep for the first night, they crawl under. And at that moment you can't get rid of them.\n\nThey follow you. Even to your death bed. The moment you die, they steal your soul and you become one of them.\n\n The only way to stop the cycle is to stop sleeping and stay awake. Never let your kid sleep. only then will the cycle end. I hope you remember this.  Its too late for me-\"\n\nbig blood stain.\n\n\"-eath bed as im writing this. Stay safe.\n\n**DONT SLEEP \"**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis one as well just seems like a horror story. I had the same feeling I had when I read the last one. I close the box and lay down to sleep. It's around 19:00(7pm)\n\nI wake up and the moon light shines through the window. I feel something applying pressure to my underside of the bed. I look to my left and see a small hand whip back under. I jolt up and look underneath the bed and see yellow eyes blink. I shine my phone under the bed and nothing is there. I shrug it off and go back to sleep. Just as I was falling asleep my phone goes off.\n\nDING\n\n\"hello jensen\"\n\nDING\n\n\"you have awakened another one\"\n\nDING\n\n\"remember... You can only end what you started\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI look at the closet remembering the events of the previous night. Its standing there again. with a new thing. \n\nThat line still echos in my head.\n\n*\"you can only end what you started\"*,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/v50zoh/my_grandpa_left_me_some_notes_pt2/,True"

"nosleep,SuperCharmander1,Open but Abandoned, I\u2019ve always had a fascination with Urban Exploring, or as my Mom calls it, walking around in abandoned moldy buildings. While that may be true, it\u2019s still an activity I like to partake in every once in a while, and what makes it such an exhilarating experience is the feeling you get while you\u2019re there. It\u2019s hard to describe, but something about seeing a place that was once bustling and full of activity, whether it be a house, a factory, or a hospital, now sit empty and decaying as nature and graffiti take over. You\u2019re overcome with emotions you\u2019ve never felt before. It\u2019s almost like looking into the mind of a dead person, if that makes any sense. The other thing is you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re gonna see while you explore an abandoned place. Maybe you\u2019ll find some old newspapers or books, come across some interesting graffiti; hell, one guy found discarded costumes and props from Pokemon Live while in a theater. At the same time, you don\u2019t know what dangers you may come across. Mold, asbestos, weak floors that\u2019ll cave in when you step on them, or maybe even a trio of mutant cannibals! There\u2019s a constant chill running down your back and the feeling that you\u2019re not supposed to be there, and yet your curiosity makes you try to explore every inch of the place before you leave. I could go on and on about the various adventures my friends and I have had while urban exploring, but there's one place that\u2019ll always stick out in my mind. A place that was so fascinating to explore not just because of the interesting architecture and statues everywhere, but because despite being empty and abandoned, it\u2019s actually still open.\n\nThe place in question is a mall, which goes by many names, but for the sake of making sure none of you seek out and find this place, I\u2019ll simply just be calling it the mall. Opened in the late 80s, the Mall was once one of the coolest places to go for kids of all ages. For younger kids, there were plenty of playsets and daycare places they could run around in, and for older kids, there was an arcade and a movie theater. Overall it was just a fun and colorful place to explore. The building had a light blue color scheme that\u2019s supposed to simulate being under the sea, and to add to that there are sculptures of various fish and coral hanging from the ceiling. But that isn\u2019t all to the theming, because there\u2019s also a gazebo with golden flying pigs standing atop its sides by the fountain, and some farm animals placed by entrances to the stores in the back. I imagine that it was a great hangout spot for those growing up in the radical 90s. I say imagine because I\u2019m a 2000s kid, and I lived about an hour away from the Mall, so I didn\u2019t really get to go to it that often, especially when it was in its prime. The only time I recall going there as a kid was when my Grandma took me to see *Puss in Boots*, and I remember walking past the Arcade and seeing *Marvel vs. Capcom 2*, a game I had heard legendary things about, and I so wanted to go in there and check out everything they had! But unfortunately, my Grandma didn\u2019t want to stand around for a few hours while I ran around playing the games, so I could only glance at the windows. But I remember thinking that once I was old enough to drive and got my license, I\u2019d gather up my friends and we\u2019d spend the whole day at that arcade! \n\nBut when that time came and I returned to the mall, I remember arriving in the empty parking lot, seeing the colors and pictures by the entrance all faded from the sun. When I went in, I found nothing but an empty building full of closed stores. I remember thinking to myself, \u201cIs this place even open?\u201d but lo and behold, the door was unlocked, the lights were on, and there were a couple of people just wandering the place. Still, it felt like I was walking into some horror game, and just around the corner there\u2019d be zombies I\u2019d have to start shooting. When I say this place was nearly dead, I mean it! Every restaurant in the food court, closed! All the kiosks, gone! Almost every store in the mall was boarded up or gated off, and that wasn\u2019t the only thing that made the place feel dead. The fountain was now shut off and sat empty, the escalators sat still, the candy in the gumball machines looked stale and gross, and there were multiple sections of the ceiling that showed devastating water damage. The only thing the staff did to deal with it was put some buckets under the leakage, which sometimes overflowed and spilled all over the floor. There were only two places in the mall that were even open. One was a Bass Pro Shop that was just connected to the mall and might as well have been a different building, and, luckily for me and my friends: The arcade was still up and running. So at the very least, I could fulfill the dreams of my childhood self, and one day I took a group of my friends to that Mall, and we spent the whole afternoon in that arcade playing *Marvel Vs. Capcom 2, Ninja Turtles, Alien 3,* and even a Japanese rhythm game that had anime openings on its soundtrack. We were able to do all of that and more for just 10 bucks each. It was a moment where we got to let go of our worries and just enjoy life for a few hours, and I\u2019ll treasure it for the rest of my life. \n\nWhen I got older and went off to college, I started to become fascinated with urban exploring, and whenever I went to an abandoned mansion or school, I always thought back to the mall because the state it was left in oftentimes didn\u2019t look too different from some of the places I checked out. I wanted to go back there again with this new mindset, instead of heading straight to the arcade I wanted to just walk all around the mall and just see what I could find. Now the number one rule of Urban Exploring is to never go alone! On top of the fact that you may need a friend in case you fall or get hurt, it\u2019s also nice to have someone to bounce off of while you\u2019re there. So during the summer break, I recruited my good friend, Kyler, and after packing some water bottles and flashlights, we headed straight for the  Mall. Our plan was to generally take a walk all around the inside of the mall and see what it was like, then we\u2019d end the day by winding down at the arcade before leaving. Trust me when I say, I wish it was that mundane and normal. \n\nWhen we first arrived, I remember being super excited to show Kyler all around the place, since he couldn\u2019t make it the day my friends and I spent the afternoon there, so it\u2019d be cool to try and show him around. We were also both big fighting game fanatics, so I was itching to kick his ass in a few rounds of *Marvel vs. Capcom 2*. But ignoring that, we were both interested to see just how dead the mall was and if there were some interesting surprises or treasures to find. When we first walked in and passed the gumball machines filled with musty candy, we were still in awe as to how such a dead-looking place could be open. One of the first things Kyler said early into our exploration was, \u201cYou know one day we should bring a whole group of people here, and we should play hide and seek.\u201d I laughed and said it was a great idea and was secretly planning out some good hiding spots while we were there. Surprisingly enough, there were a handful of people still walking around the mall, often just taking a walk in a place with air conditioning, or sitting down at a bench reading a book. I guess it would be a pretty cool place to go if you just wanted some peace and quiet because there was hardly any talking and no music playing throughout the entire place; you could hear a raindrop hit the ceiling. \n\nOther than the Arcade and the playground, there really wasn\u2019t much of note that Kyler and I found unless you counted looking at blacked-out windows of closed stores. There was a place that looked like a bar that had nothing stopping you from climbing over the surprisingly short railings, but it looked basically empty so we passed it by. However, when we came across the movie theater, things got a little bit interesting. The outside had still had the labels for the last movies that played there, and though there was a security curtain blocking the entrance, you could still look inside and see the box office, concession stands, and the paths to the theaters. I could\u2019ve sworn I saw someone around the corner but it was too dark to really be able to tell.  But on top of everything else, the security curtain wasn\u2019t actually touching the floor, and we could even slip our toes under it. After experimenting with how far we could stick our feet in there, Kyler got down on his knees and actually reached his arm in the theater. When pulling it back, he bumped the security curtain and it actually moved up a little bit.  \n\n\u201cDude, I think this thing is a bit loose!\u201d Kyler said ecstatically.\n\n\u201cReally, I wonder how far it goes up.\u201d I said as I kneeled down next to him and grabbed the gate. I lifted it and though it got stuck after a few inches, it still was a big enough gap that the both of us could easily slip through. \n\n\u201cAw man, someone could easily get back in there if they wanted to.\u201d Kyler half-joked as he stood up.  \n\n\u201cYeah, but let\u2019s not get that risky, especially since it\u2019s still the middle of the day and we haven\u2019t even gone to the arcade yet.\u201d I said as I put it back down and stood up. Kyler agreed and we walked off to continue our exploration.\n\nOnce we made it to the other end of the mall, we decided to head back to the Arcade and spend the rest of our day there, but almost immediately when we turned around, we saw a middle-aged guy with a mustache in uniform coming towards us on a segway. When he got off and approached us, he barked at us angrily, \u201cI know you two were trying to get into the theater!\u201d and before I could say sorry he pointed his fingers at the door and said, \u201cGet out!\u201d We didn\u2019t want to make a scene or get into any more trouble so we just said sorry and left the building. Needless to say, we were a little pissed off when we got outside, having our day cut abruptly and not even getting to go into the arcade. I understood where the security guard came from, I\u2019m sure he had kids constantly trying to sneak into the closed-off stores and he felt like he needed to just be blunt and kick out whoever got close to the line, but we had driven out an hour to get there and we spent about the same amount of time inside. Kyler wasn\u2019t having any of it though, and basically said, \u201cMan, that guy was an asshole.\u201d \n\nWe walked back to my car and since I did still feel bad about our trip being cut short, I asked Kyler if I should look up some nearby places for us to check out\u2014but he had another idea in mind. Without any hesitation, Kyler said, \u201cI wanna go back in there.\u201d\n\n\u201cKyler, no. If we go back in, he might call the cops and have us arrested.\u201d I replied, not wanting to jeopardize my college career by going to jail.\n\n\u201cNo we won\u2019t, if that guy could arrest us, he would\u2019ve done it right then and there.\u201d \n\n\u201cYeah, but he can still call the police and they can put us in cuffs. The guard told us to leave and I don\u2019t want to get in any more trouble.\u201d \n\n\u201cNo come on, you can\u2019t just live your life worrying about everything, you gotta take some risks and get some excitement. Besides, now that we\u2019ve been kicked out, the entire mall is now an equal playing field, including that theater.\u201d \n\nNone of my worries got through to him, and honestly, I half agreed with his viewpoint so that made it even harder to argue. Soon enough, I gave in, but I didn\u2019t want to just waltz back into the mall without a plan, and thankfully we were on the same page. So we decided to walk to a nearby supermarket and pick up some extra water bottles, some rubber gloves in case of broken glass, and a couple of face masks if there was black mold. After stashing it all in a backpack, we then got dinner at a nearby restaurant. While there, I pulled out my phone and started researching the mall to see if there were any helpful tips on places that were easy to sneak into and how to avoid security. I guess I shouldn\u2019t have been surprised that people weren\u2019t sharing trespassing tips online, but what I did find is that the Mall is actually a bit more strict than its empty interior would make you think. Multiple people posted about how the second security saw them not heading towards one of the two establishments, they\u2019d suddenly start popping up around every corner with their eyes on you. If you brought in a camera or even looked like you were gonna take a picture with your phone, they\u2019d kick you out of the mall without a warning. Come to think of it, I didn\u2019t see any security cameras around the whole place, yet when Kyler and I were at the cinema, there was no one around. Yet the guard almost immediately caught us a minute after we had left the theater, and there wasn\u2019t a trace of him before then. It was almost like he rode through a portal on that segway right in front of us. It was strange, whenever I went urban exploring, one of the factors that make it so chilling is the feeling that there could be someone watching you in this lost place you\u2019re trespassing on. With this mall that wasn\u2019t just a feeling, there *were* people there watching you, and apparently they never took their eyes off you. \n\nBy the time Kyler and I got back to the mall, it was about 8 pm, the sun was starting to set and it\u2019d be about an hour before the arcade was scheduled to close, so the place was even emptier than usual. We opened up the door and made our way through the mall while trying to stick to the side and hide behind objects. Anytime we saw a security guard or heard footsteps that sounded close by, we\u2019d move either up or down the stairs to try and avoid them. During this time, I looked around to see if there were any security cameras, and to my surprise, I couldn\u2019t spot any of them. Not the classic box style ones nor the newer circular ones were in sight, and we went about halfway into the mall. Maybe they had cameras that were just so advanced they could camouflage with the rest of the building, but how could a mall that couldn\u2019t fix one of the many areas with water damage afford a security system that advanced? I\u2019ll admit, the mall was only more unsettling at night. Without the sun shining through the glass on the ceiling, it really showed how few lights were actually on in the building. The downstairs was almost completely unlit, and just about every hallway that went off the main path upstairs was pitch black. Luckily there was just enough light that we could navigate our way through the Mall without having to use our flashlights. But still, my heart was pounding as we went through the mall, and it felt like all the flying pig and fish sculptures were staring at me judgmentally whenever I glanced at one of them.\n\nWe finally reached the theater and the security gate was sticking above the ground just as we left it, and there wasn\u2019t anyone in our immediate vicinity so it seemed like this was the best chance we had if we were gonna go through with this. Approaching the security curtains, I lifted it up as Kyler slipped under, then held it for me so I could get in, dropping it after I was through. Quickly we moved to the walls to try to stay out of sight and began scanning the place for any leftover movie posters or standees we could pose with. There wasn\u2019t really anything we could see initially besides broken pieces of some of the tiles on the red floors, as well as some sort of mural of a movie camera with a film reel running through it. Truth be told, part of the reason we couldn\u2019t see much was that it was so dark, and we didn\u2019t want to turn on our flashlights so close to the entrance. \n\nBut seeing that mural did remind me that a bit past the concession stands, there was another piece of art past the concession stands that I saw when I went to this cinema with my Grandma almost a decade ago. I didn\u2019t remember much, just that it had a circle of film reels with a few pictures of famous actors in movies over it, like Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka, Pierce Brosnan as James Bond, and Halle Berry in I think the *Flintstones* movie. I wanted to see if that mural was still there and maybe if I could recognize all the actors and movies on it, so as I slid back and got to some stairs leading to the theater rooms, we sat down at the bottom and I took out my flashlight. Upon shining it on the upper ends of the wall, the mural was right where I remembered it, but something about it felt\u2026 off. I thought maybe some of it was torn off, but it was more like someone painted over almost all of it. The only picture that was still visible was Halley Berry, but the rest of it had some sort of jet black muck all over, and everything it covered was completely gone. Worst of all was the odor it gave off, a strong bitter smell that reminded me of cough medicine. I turned to Kyler to see if I wasn\u2019t crazy, but he could see it too. He suggested that maybe it was mold, but I shot that down immediately. Not only does mold not smell like that, but even in places I explored that were abandoned since the 80s, the mold\u2019s color wasn\u2019t that strong or thick, and it normally spread in multiple dots of many different sizes, not one big blob you could fit a car into. Kyler reassured me that it was probably just some damage and it wouldn\u2019t be dangerous as long as we acted smart, so I swallowed and decided to head further in. Still, I was even more nervous than before about doing this, and I could feel my legs trembling as I stood up and walked. \n\nAs we got closer to the back, we looked down a hallway of doors to the individual theaters, some of them even still had the names of the movies that were playing in them. Though the feeling of \u2018*no way out\u2019* really struck me when I saw that there was nothing but a dead end on the other side of the hallway. Still, we wanted to go into the actual theaters since it was an area we couldn\u2019t see outside, so it might make for some cool pictures where security couldn\u2019t spot us. But we were still wary that the guards might be on to us, so we decided to go in shifts. While one of us would go into a screening room and look around, the other would stand by the edge of the hall and keep watch on the entrance. Then when one came back from the theater, they\u2019d watch the front while the other would explore another room. After that, we planned on getting out because we figured once you\u2019ve seen one screening room you\u2019ve seen them all. Kyler was the first one on guard duty, which means that I was the lucky winner of being the first to enter these dark dusty rooms by myself. Slipping the gloves and mask on, I took a deep breath and grabbed the cold door handle, and entered theater one. \n\nI didn\u2019t even wait for the door to close before I turned my flashlight on, I was too on edge to be in complete darkness. As I walked further into the seats and the screen, I looked around and everything looked about how I expected at first glance. All rows of seats were folded up and the stairs were covered in asbestos and more broken pieces of the ceiling. The screen was white and had mold hovering around the edges and the glass where the projector was supposed to be was shattered, almost looking like someone made off with it. The walls almost had the same black muck covering them as the mural, though these ended before they reached the lights. Though that foul odor was all the more apparent, and it made me almost want to hold my breath while I was in there. I walked further down in the hopes I could get an up-close look at the screen, but I suddenly stopped in between the two front rows when I felt something crack beneath my feet. I looked down and saw that I stepped on a pair of glasses, which felt strange because there were no soda cans, beer bottles, or other trash you\u2019d expect to find in an abandoned business. I shined my light down to the ground and my heart nearly sunk when I saw that it wasn\u2019t just the glasses, but there were also earrings, a pair of shoes, and even a hoodie with some jeans next to it. Was someone else in here and is now running around in the theater? What if they were attacked and after being knocked out they were stripped? I immediately turned, startled, shining my flashlight all over the room. I began shouting, \u201cHello! Is anyone there!?\u201d No one in sight. I began to feel a bit lightheaded and nauseous as if I was gonna faint. I tried to head back towards the door but I swayed to the side and my arm ran into the wall and\u2026 and\u2026 it began to sink. \n\nA tight squeeze gripped the front of my arm as I shined my light down and saw that the black muck had made it all the way to the bottom of the wall, and I was touching it. No, my forearm was straight up sinking in there like it was a pool of oil, and the smell was overwhelming at this point. My arm only sunk in further by the second, and soon enough it got my wrist. I lost all feeling in it. My hand just twitched as I gripped my fingers, but if I didn\u2019t act fast it\u2019d be next! I pressed my foot to the bottom of the wall and began pulling. No use, I could barely wiggle my shoulder in there, and now my palm had been fully overtaken. \u201cKYLER! KYLER HELP ME!\u201d I yelled out with all the energy I could muster. I screamed louder than I ever had in my life and I felt my lungs shrivel as I did. \u201cKYLER! I\u2019M SERIOUS MAN! *I\u2019M GONNA FUCKING DIE!*\u201d I coughed violently after bellowing out that last cry. My leg began to twitch and as I looked down, I saw my foot sinking into the same black sludge. I closed my eyes and felt tears streaming down my face. I just wanted to hang out with a friend for the day, trying to live the best years of my life. I didn\u2019t want to die, not now, I had so much ahead of me. Finishing school, getting to publish my work, and having a house and a family. All of it would be gone because I let Kyler convince me to do this. No\u2026 it wasn\u2019t Kyler\u2019s fault, he couldn\u2019t have known this would happen. It was my idea to come here. With tears still streaming down my face, I closed my eyes and allowed myself to sink into the wall\u2026\n\nThat\u2019s when I heard a loud bang from across the room and a beam of light forced my eyes open. Kyler came rushing in towards me as the gunk spread around the wall beside him, but he kept his eyes straight on me. \u201cWhat the hell is going on!?\u201d He yelled as he approached me. \u201cI don\u2019t know man, just get me out of here!\u201d I said with a wet and sweaty face as I held my free hand up towards him. By now my shoulder was almost in the wall and it would only be a matter of time before it got to my torso, or even worse, my face. Kyler grabbed my hand and began to pull, and I tried to help him by pushing with my free foot. It felt like I was barely moving an inch, and time was running out: my shoulder was already halfway through. Kyler grabbed one of his water bottles and splashed into the area my arm was in. It was probably a desperate attempt to try anything, but by some miracle, once the water was splashed on it, the muck actually began to recede. I began to fall out of the wall and I could feel my arm and foot again as I inched back into the room. Giving it one last tug, Kyler was able to pull me fully out, and as I fell into his arms, I hugged them tightly. \u201cOH MY GOD! THANK YOU! *THANK YOU!*\u201d I screamed for just a second as Kyler hugged back and we quickly let go. The black gunk was looming over us from the ceiling as a reminder that we were still in danger. I looked at my arm and saw that the sleeve of my shirt was missing, and not just torn. It was like it was cut off with perfect precision. Same with the front of my shoe, and the glove was completely gone. I didn\u2019t have time to think though, as Kyler tugged my arm and we both started running towards the exit. \n\nKicking the door open we made our way back to the exit, and now all the walls were completely encased in the black substance. The security curtain rattled as we almost crashed running into it. The mall outside was starting to turn off the lights, it looked like they were about to close. \u201cUh, dude, this thing isn\u2019t moving!\u201d Kyler yelled as he tugged at the bottom of the gate, it staying completely stagnant. I looked and saw the wall around the security curtain was covered in the black muck and it was now encasing it. I took out one of my water bottles and began splashing the side of the walls, hoping that would do the trick, but despite the muck dissipating again, the security curtain wasn\u2019t moving an inch vertically, we could only rattle it back and forth. I had to think fast, so I turned to Kyler and said, \u201cSplash as much water as you can on the walls and then let\u2019s step back to the concession stands. On three, we\u2019re going to charge!\u201d  I wasn\u2019t so sure of this plan myself, I was still shaking and shivering as I said each word, but Kyler just gave me a reassuring nod and splashed his side of the wall. He had faith in me, so I had to do the same. After I splashed my edge of the wall, we ran back as far as we could, the gunk still emerging around us, and we got into position. \u201cOne\u2026 *two*\u2026 ***THREE!***\u201d We both yelled as we charged at the gate with every bit of strength we had left in us. We crashed right through the security curtain and brought it down with us, our faces slammed right into the floor. I stood up as I felt a scratch on my chin, and Kyler had a bloody nose, but we didn\u2019t care. Scrambling to our feet, we sprinted straight towards the nearest exit. The muck began to creep into the mall behind us, but then suddenly stopped once it reached one of the parts of the roof with heavy water damage. I looked back and saw as I looked back to see the same security guard we ran into before just standing at the edge of the cinema, just watching us\u2026 \n\nThe doors banged against the wall as we came bursting out and sprinting through the parking lot. I hit the alarm on my car and it began to beep loudly, making it much easier to get to. We reached the car,  I unlocked the doors and we immediately sat down and buckled up. Once I switched the car on and put it into drive, I stomped on the gas and the engine roared as we sped out of the parking lot. We finally calmed down a bit as we made it onto the main road and began driving home, though both of us were panting heavily and couldn\u2019t even muster up enough breath to talk. Still, just looking at each other, we could see the trauma in our eyes as we tried to process just what any of that was! Where did it come from, why was it there? These were just some of the millions of questions we had going through our minds that we knew full well would never be answered. But at the very least, we were alive and safe, and that\u2019s all that mattered. \n\nIt\u2019s been a few years since that incident, and not only have I not gone back to that mall, I haven\u2019t really done much Urban Exploring in general. The pandemic turned me into a bit of a germaphobe, and between finishing up college, working a full-time job, and taking care of my own place, I just don\u2019t really have the time to research a place and then try to call someone up to explore it with for a few hours. Besides, I didn't want to have any panic attacks if I thought too much about that incident while I was exploring. Luckily it seems Kyler has fully recovered from this incident as well, and has been pursuing a career as a traveling photographer. We still hang out to this day, but when it comes to the incident, we rarely bring it up. We never told the police or anyone about it, fearing that the Mall may find out it was us and send their secret police after us or something. So for now we mainly just end the story after we got kicked out and left it at that. \n\n I still check on the mall online every once in a while, just to see if anyone saw the same thing as me and Kyler, as well as any new discoveries people may have found. Turns out the mall finally closed its doors and is actually going to be demolished in a few months, and in its place, they\u2019re going to build some apartments and office buildings. Maybe some people would think good riddance after what I went through, but I\u2019m honestly a little sad to see it go. Despite everything, I have a lot of memories of not only going to that mall, but also driving past it and wanting to check out the arcade, then finally getting that chance and finding a new appreciation for what that place had become in the years it spent in purgatory. Though honestly, I\u2019m also afraid. Whatever was in there, whatever had me, is it gone, or is it still around? Is it going to be able to snatch people while they\u2019re alone in their apartments, just small families ripped away from the earth in their own homes?! It makes me sick to my stomach just thinking about it, and it\u2019s not helping that this morning when I woke up, I noticed a spec of black muck on my arm\u2026,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/v5110p/open_but_abandoned/,False"

"nosleep,VocalBlueberries,I visited the old abandoned laboratory I used to work at. I shouldn't have.,About 20 years ago, I got a job at a new laboratory complex that had just finished construction. I was fresh out of the university and was exited to work with fellow science loving individuals in such a fresh complex. The whole complex was built some 10 miles outside the town I lived at. It was in a remote location completely surrounded by a thick forest. It was built above a small coal mine which was shut down after the mining company went bankrupt. The moment I set foot into the complex, I felt uneasy about the place. At first I shrugged it off as strange butterflies of excitement, but even after months of working there, it never went away.\n\nThe company in charge of the complex was shady in the best meaning of the word. The first month, I mostly worked in and near the reception desk, dealing with paperwork of arriving shipments of scientific equipment and raw materials. I was told that this was to \"Make sure I'm trustworthy\". Some would've quit after a week or two but I was assured that soon enough, they'll come to a verdict and I'll be able to \"Use my knowledge to advance science\".\n\nOne early morning, a shipment came in that wasn't in the schedule. My boss just told me not to worry as the schedule might be incorrect and told me to have the crates taken to wing 4. While I waited for the facility's transport truck to come around, I started to wonder what the crates had in them since the logistics schedule usually lists the contents. Normally, the large metal crates contain refrigerated goods like plant samples so I figured there was no harm in checking. I barely got a peek into the crate when my boss walked in and fired me on the spot. He refused to tell me why I was fired since we are usually allowed to check the crates unless instructed otherwise. I walked home that day sad but relived since I didn't have to be in that unnerving place ever again.\n\nIn the following 20 years, I got a new job on the other side of the country, got married and had kids. I had almost forgotten that old complex for good if it hadn't driven past the gravel road leading up to the complex while visiting some old friends at the town. This prompted me to look up the complex on the internet. It turned out that about six years after I departed, the company in charge got under fire for not following safety guidelines. The whole facility was shut down after a handful of employees went missing and the CEO of the company took their own life. Being adventurous, I rang my friends and asked if they wanted to to and explore the complex. Out of the six of us, two immediately declined as they had heard stories of weird stuff going on in the complex and didn't like the thought of going missing. \n\nLooking back to that moment, I was stupid. I fell right into the horror movie trope of exploring the creepy location even when there was concrete evidence that something wasn't right over there. I suppose I thought that fate would protect the fools like me.\n\nSo it was the four of us: Me, Jonathan, Michael and Brent. We met at Brent's house to prepare us. Because a section of the complex was now under water, Jonathan brought two sets of scuba gear. Since I am the same length as he is, it was decided that I would get the second set in case we want to explore the underwater section. We also packed headlamps and handheld flashlights for everyone, plus some heavy duty walkie talkies in case we got separated. As I was the only person to have worked there, I advised to bring along a Geiger counter or two just to be safe. We then loaded everything in my car and headed to the complex.\n\nArriving at the main gates, I was surprised to not have that odd feeling like I did when I worked here 20 years ago. Since the gates were chained shut, we left the car behind and walked the rest of the way. The fence already had holes in them so we definitely weren't the first ones around. It was at this point when I turned the Geiger counter on. It beeped a little, it picked up normal background radiation. At least we now knew that it worked. \n\nWalking around this old complex was cooler than I thought. It was interesting to see how much nature had taken over in 20 years. Most of the place was trashed, probably by all the people who came here before us or by the employees when the place shut down. There was one place I wanted to really see with my own eyes, something I wasn't able to see back in the day. It was the 4th wing. The 4th wing was where all the classified experiments happened. I knew that the wing was probably as empty as the rest of the complex but my childish curiosity wanted to see what it was all about. The wing was built into a large trench-like hole in the ground. This hole had been filled with rainwater after multiple floods occurred in the area and most of the wing was underwater. \n\nJonathan and I went back to the car and got ourselves into our scuba gear while Brent and Michael stayed behind to look for a good entrance into the 4th wing. We regrouped at the central square and the two lead me and Jonathan through the complex to the lowest floor not to be under water. There was a stairwell leading down which was almost completely full of water besides a small section at the very top. Jonathan and I checked the tanks and then hopped in. The water was cold so we swam fast to get some warmth into our bodies. We soon reached the bottom of the stairwell. Our plan was to start from the bottom and go upward floor by floor, swimming together to make sure we don't lose each other. Most of everything was damaged beyond recognition by the water. If there were any documents here, they are definitely gone by now.\n\nWe eventually reached the large cargo elevator. For the heck of it, I tried to pull open the doors. They moved slightly. Jonathan realized what I tried to do and came to help. We got the doors open enough to get through and noticed that the elevator shaft goes down a lot further than it should. There was at least three more floors down there. Jonathan gestured to me if we should head down. I was hesitant at first but we went anyways. I was mostly worried about the water pressure more than anything but Jonathan was an experienced diver so I figured he knew what we were capable of doing. I gestured him to lead the way and followed him. We went all the way to the bottom and pried the door open. \n\nThis is where the strange feeling I had all those years ago came back. Beyond the elevator door was an airlock. It was almost like the designers knew that this place would flood. We got the door open and closed the door after us. The airlock had a lever with instructions to pull when the airlock gets filled with water. It seemed like a stupid idea since the place was without electricity but I pulled the lever. Miraculously, the water started to flow away and soon we were able to open the other airlock door.\n\nThe air was stale but breathable, at least there was no water. We tried to radio the folk upstairs but nothing. The amount of water and concrete above us must have been blocking the signal. I had also brought the Geiger counter with us. It now was beeping a bit more intensely. Nothing that could harm us but definitely higher than the average background radiation. Along the wall was written: \"Tauris Complex - Wing 4 - Section 31\". \n\nJonathan had started exploring the nearby rooms, so I did too. I quickly found a large library of files. All of the filing cabinets were for a single project. Some projects even had a second cabinet. I picked the one closest to me and opened it. The tag on the cabinet simply read \"Project: Skygate\". They were trying to build small scale particle accelerators to then use to teleport physical matter from one point to another. It mostly seemed like theoretical work though. \n\nThe second cabinet read \"Project: Graywoolener\". The head of the project was the company's CEO himself. It seemed like they tried to do genetic experiments on living beings, at first starting with rats but soon testing on sheep and eventually on human volunteers. Around this point, I was interrupted by Jonathan. He asked me to follow him and keep an eye on the rads per minute as we were going along. I took the file I was reading with me and followed Jonathan. The rads increased as we were walking. We eventually got to a large door made of steel and concrete. \n\nThe text on it was scuffed beyond recognition but there was something I clearly could read. A black trefoil within a yellow ring - the radiation warning symbol. Hesitantly, we opened the heavy door and found ourselves above a compact nuclear fission reactor. It was nothing massive but definitely powerful enough to power the entire wing. We agreed that we should probably leave it alone, there's no way of telling how much damage the reactor has taken in the past two decades. \n\nWe left the reactor chamber and closed the door. Jonathan went to look around a bit more while I went to look if any of the lights work as we hadn't really checked them before. I returned to the library and tried the light switch. It worked. I found a desk and a chair in the corner so I sat down and radioed Jonathan to let him known my whereabouts. This is what I heard in response: \"I hear ya, Patrick. I just found some cages. One of them seems to be smashed to pie- \\*tumbling\\* \\*scream\\* \\*transmission end beep\\* \"\n\n\"Jonathan?! Jonathan?!\" I screamed into the walkie talkie. I got no response. My fight or flight sense triggered, I started panicking. I jumped up from the chair and bolted across the corridor into a storage, looking for something to defend myself from whatever just attacked Jonathan. I found a large hydraulic piston, tested the weight and then started to sneak around the corridors. I had no idea what I should do besides look for Jonathan. I probably should've ran to the airlock and escaped, but it felt wrong to leave him behind. I had reached the point where we split up when I heard footsteps. Loud and slow footsteps, echoing through the corridor. I went and hid behind a door, it could've been Jonathan or it could've been the thing that attacked him. \n\nI couldn't tell what or who it was since it was dark but whatever it was, it passed me without issue. As soon as I heard it take a corner, I bolted out and started looking for Jonathan. I soon found the room he was talking about. It was filled with multiple cages, almost like cells. One of these cells had the bars bent and twisted. By the way they were moved, it was caused by something on the inside. I found Jonathan groaning by the wall. He had hit the concrete wall with his head so hard that he was bleeding. \"It's human, but... not.\" he said before passing out. I checked his pulse. It was erratic and he was bleeding badly. I looked around for something to help him, bolting across the corridor as quietly as I could. I happened to find some old rolls of bandages and cloth towels. I went back to him, set the towel at on the wound and secured it by wrapping the bandages around his head.\n\nThen I heard the footsteps again. I was forced to leave him there and hide behind one of the cages. The thing stepped into the room. I heard it breathe heavily, then take a few steps towards my way. I was holding by breath to make sure I didn't make much noise but the thing was in the room longer than I could handle. I had to breathe but quietly. The echo of the room and my frightened exhale was too loud. The next thing I heard was loud stomping towards me. I ran towards the corridor. I heard the loud clang of the metal cage. I turned around and flicked on my flashlight. The thing matched Jonathans description. It was human, but not. It was tall, at least 16 feet tall. It's posture was hunched and it's muscle mass was definitely enough to demolish a metal cage. It's eyes were sowed shut, the ears were disproportionately massive.\n\nI turned around and ran. I didn't care where, I just ran. The thing had issues with running in the tight halls so I was able to outrun him. I found a small metal door, one that I hadn't seen before. I opened it and closed it after myself. The room I found myself in was a dead end, it was a server room. It was fully operational, just heavily outdated. I found a terminal to access and realized that there is still an internet connection, albeit a very slow one. The whole thing ran on Windows Vista, but I was able to get to grips with it enough to make myself a Reddit account and write this post. \n\nI have also read some of that file that I took with me. Although the first animal tests proved successful, the first human test failed, killing the test subject. After three more deaths, a new gene therapy formula was formed which meant that the second test was a success. The subject seemed normal at first, but within the next 12 hours, his muscle mass, hearing, eyesight and skeletal structure increased. 24 hours after that, the subject started to regard the scientists as \"inferior beings\" and became violent towards others. They then tried to hinder him by removing his ability to see but as the gene therapy was still actively changing the subject from the inside, the subject simply hyper-evolved to have better hearing. He was then put into a tungsten cage on the lowest level of the wing before his body became immune to the sedatives. In the cage he grew in size and strength before breaking free and killing eight scientists. \n\nThe CEO blamed himself in the report and wrote a line at the bottom of the report: \"To the person reading this, you have either managed to take him down or you are actively hiding from him. If you are doing the latter, I'd advise you to pray to God for the last time.\" I have heard a couple of loud slams against the door, it seems to hold him for now. I'll probably die from hunger and thirst or by him. Jonathan is most likely already dead. \n\nThis isn't a plea for help. And for God's sake, don't come here to save us or you'll end up with us. I'm writing this mostly to Brent, Michael and to my family. Keep going without us, you're strong enough but also remember us and don't be as dumb like Jonathan and I because it was our stupidity that got us killed.\n\n\\- Patrick,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/v514ps/i_visited_the_old_abandoned_laboratory_i_used_to/,False"
"TwoXChromosomes,hideousbeautifulface,Risk assessment with males (friends and exes),This is something I have been thinking about a lot lately because I'm having to deal with it. My ex and I amicably broke up in early April. He was planning to join the military and move wherever that sent him and I wasn't willing to move and I am also going through a period where I am wanting to explore my sexuality more because I've realized I think I might be bi. But whatever the point is the break up was amicable. \n\nFast forward to mid May. Ex pops back up. He got a job so didnt join the military, moved back to our town and wanted to get back together. He got an apartment for himself all that. When he asked about getting back together I initially said \"i dont know man\" but in my tone I meant \"no\". But that was my fault I wasn't direct enough. He said ok. He then mentioned he wanted me to see his apartment because he was proud of it. This is where the risk assessment comes in. I used to trust him so much. And always want to be around him. But it is different now. We are no longer together. I don't think he would ever hurt me. He is a good person. But that is just not a position I want to put myself in. But he get's all sad saying I will never come over and see it. And then I feel bad because I feel like I am making him out to be a monster when he isn't. But this is my boundary and I am sticking to it.\n\nAlso, after that initial discussion where I shot him down basically. We met again the next week to hang out and he asked me how serious I was about not getting back together or if he just had to wait until I was ready. Again, it is my fault for not being more direct. I'm just very frustrated because I think he is a good person but the more he presses me the more annoyed I get and then I feel like and asshole because I feel like I am villainizing him over nothing.\n\n\nBottom line: no I am never going to see your apartment so stop asking me to come over,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/v514qm/risk_assessment_with_males_friends_and_exes/,False"

Before we got off i told him to look and he went to go see what it was. He looked and was admiring them for a while. His mom eventually came in his room to give him his laundry. \n\nShe saw my coochie n my boobies ALL on his tv screen and she SCREAMED she ran out of his room.

"books,justinsdrown,In A Journal of the Plague Year is Daniel Defoe employing the use of an unreliable narrator? [Spoilers],Hi all. New to posting here. Please, be patient with me. \n\nIn the book A Journal of the Plague Year our protagonist directly contradicts himself throughout. At times H. F. things that the plague targets those deserving of it. Liars, cheats, etc. There's a group of rowdy bar patrons that make fun of the dying and poor. H.F. literally believes they are smited by god one by one over the course of four days.\n\nThe thing is... these guys wander the city. They rub shoulders with people fresh from the burial pits. H.F. even talks frequently about innocent and poor people taken by the plague.\n\nAnd this is not the only example. H.F. doesn't believe isolating from the plague helps. That it only made the plague worse somehow? H.F. forgets things. Stories are cut off and admitted to be hearsay later. You get the idea. I should have taken notes. But like H.F. you'll have to take my word for it, haha. \n\nWhat I'm trying to understand is if Defoe intentionally presents H.F. as unreliable. Or is the book simply outdated. Any help would be appreciated. I blasted through this one in a couple of days and it has my thoughts racing.,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/v517p7/in_a_journal_of_the_plague_year_is_daniel_defoe/,False"

"nosleep,SuperCharmander1,Open But Abandoned,I\u2019ve always had a fascination with Urban Exploring, or as my Mom calls it, walking around in abandoned moldy buildings. While that may be true, it\u2019s still an activity I like to partake in every once in a while, and what makes it such an exhilarating experience is the feeling you get while you\u2019re there. It\u2019s hard to describe, but something about seeing a place that was once bustling and full of activity, whether it be a house, a factory, or a hospital, now sit empty and decaying as nature and graffiti take over. You\u2019re overcome with emotions you\u2019ve never felt before. It\u2019s almost like looking into the mind of a dead person, if that makes any sense. The other thing is you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re gonna see while you explore an abandoned place. Maybe you\u2019ll find some old newspapers or books, come across some interesting graffiti; hell, one guy found discarded costumes and props from Pokemon Live while in a theater. At the same time, you don\u2019t know what dangers you may come across. Mold, asbestos, weak floors that\u2019ll cave in when you step on them, or maybe even a trio of mutant cannibals! There\u2019s a constant chill running down your back and the feeling that you\u2019re not supposed to be there, and yet your curiosity makes you try to explore every inch of the place before you leave. I could go on and on about the various adventures my friends and I have had while urban exploring, but there's one place that\u2019ll always stick out in my mind. A place that was so fascinating to explore not just because of the interesting architecture and statues everywhere, but because despite being empty and abandoned, it\u2019s actually still open.\n\nThe place in question is a mall, which goes by many names, but for the sake of making sure none of you seek out and find this place, I\u2019ll simply just be calling it the mall. Opened in the late 80s, the Mall was once one of the coolest places to go for kids of all ages. For younger kids, there were plenty of playsets and daycare places they could run around in, and for older kids, there was an arcade and a movie theater. Overall it was just a fun and colorful place to explore. The building had a light blue color scheme that\u2019s supposed to simulate being under the sea, and to add to that there are sculptures of various fish and coral hanging from the ceiling. But that isn\u2019t all to the theming, because there\u2019s also a gazebo with golden flying pigs standing atop its sides by the fountain, and some farm animals placed by entrances to the stores in the back. I imagine that it was a great hangout spot for those growing up in the radical 90s. I say imagine because I\u2019m a 2000s kid, and I lived about an hour away from the Mall, so I didn\u2019t really get to go to it that often, especially when it was in its prime. The only time I recall going there as a kid was when my Grandma took me to see *Puss in Boots*, and I remember walking past the Arcade and seeing *Marvel vs. Capcom 2*, a game I had heard legendary things about, and I so wanted to go in there and check out everything they had! But unfortunately, my Grandma didn\u2019t want to stand around for a few hours while I ran around playing the games, so I could only glance at the windows. But I remember thinking that once I was old enough to drive and got my license, I\u2019d gather up my friends and we\u2019d spend the whole day at that arcade! \n\nBut when that time came and I returned to the mall, I remember arriving in the empty parking lot, seeing the colors and pictures by the entrance all faded from the sun. When I went in, I found nothing but an empty building full of closed stores. I remember thinking to myself, \u201cIs this place even open?\u201d but lo and behold, the door was unlocked, the lights were on, and there were a couple of people just wandering the place. Still, it felt like I was walking into some horror game, and just around the corner there\u2019d be zombies I\u2019d have to start shooting. When I say this place was nearly dead, I mean it! Every restaurant in the food court, closed! All the kiosks, gone! Almost every store in the mall was boarded up or gated off, and that wasn\u2019t the only thing that made the place feel dead. The fountain was now shut off and sat empty, the escalators sat still, the candy in the gumball machines looked stale and gross, and there were multiple sections of the ceiling that showed devastating water damage. The only thing the staff did to deal with it was put some buckets under the leakage, which sometimes overflowed and spilled all over the floor. There were only two places in the mall that were even open. One was a Bass Pro Shop that was just connected to the mall and might as well have been a different building, and, luckily for me and my friends: The arcade was still up and running. \n\nSo at the very least, I could fulfill the dreams of my childhood self, and one day I took a group of my friends to that Mall, and we spent the whole afternoon in that arcade playing *Marvel Vs. Capcom 2, Ninja Turtles, Alien 3,* and even a Japanese rhythm game that had anime openings on its soundtrack. We were able to do all of that and more for just 10 bucks each. It was a moment where we got to let go of our worries and just enjoy life for a few hours, and I\u2019ll treasure it for the rest of my life. \n\nWhen I got older and went off to college, I started to become fascinated with urban exploring, and whenever I went to an abandoned mansion or school, I always thought back to the mall because the state it was left in oftentimes didn\u2019t look too different from some of the places I checked out. I wanted to go back there again with this new mindset, instead of heading straight to the arcade I wanted to just walk all around the mall and just see what I could find. Now the number one rule of Urban Exploring is to never go alone! On top of the fact that you may need a friend in case you fall or get hurt, it\u2019s also nice to have someone to bounce off of while you\u2019re there. So during the summer break, I recruited my good friend, Kyler, and after packing some water bottles and flashlights, we headed straight for the  Mall. Our plan was to generally take a walk all around the inside of the mall and see what it was like, then we\u2019d end the day by winding down at the arcade before leaving. Trust me when I say, I wish it was that mundane and normal. \n\nWhen we first arrived, I remember being super excited to show Kyler all around the place, since he couldn\u2019t make it the day my friends and I spent the afternoon there, so it\u2019d be cool to try and show him around. We were also both big fighting game fanatics, so I was itching to kick his ass in a few rounds of *Marvel vs. Capcom 2*. But ignoring that, we were both interested to see just how dead the mall was and if there were some interesting surprises or treasures to find. When we first walked in and passed the gumball machines filled with musty candy, we were still in awe as to how such a dead-looking place could be open. One of the first things Kyler said early into our exploration was, \u201cYou know one day we should bring a whole group of people here, and we should play hide and seek.\u201d I laughed and said it was a great idea and was secretly planning out some good hiding spots while we were there. Surprisingly enough, there were a handful of people still walking around the mall, often just taking a walk in a place with air conditioning, or sitting down at a bench reading a book. I guess it would be a pretty cool place to go if you just wanted some peace and quiet because there was hardly any talking and no music playing throughout the entire place; you could hear a raindrop hit the ceiling. \n\nOther than the Arcade and the playground, there really wasn\u2019t much of note that Kyler and I found unless you counted looking at blacked-out windows of closed stores. There was a place that looked like a bar that had nothing stopping you from climbing over the surprisingly short railings, but it looked basically empty so we passed it by. However, when we came across the movie theater, things got a little bit interesting. The outside had still had the labels for the last movies that played there, and though there was a security curtain blocking the entrance, you could still look inside and see the box office, concession stands, and the paths to the theaters. I could\u2019ve sworn I saw someone around the corner but it was too dark to really be able to tell.  But on top of everything else, the security curtain wasn\u2019t actually touching the floor, and we could even slip our toes under it. After experimenting with how far we could stick our feet in there, Kyler got down on his knees and actually reached his arm in the theater. When pulling it back, he bumped the security curtain and it actually moved up a little bit.  \n\n\u201cDude, I think this thing is a bit loose!\u201d Kyler said ecstatically.\n\n\u201cReally, I wonder how far it goes up.\u201d I said as I kneeled down next to him and grabbed the gate. I lifted it and though it got stuck after a few inches, it still was a big enough gap that the both of us could easily slip through. \n\n\u201cAw man, someone could easily get back in there if they wanted to.\u201d Kyler half-joked as he stood up.  \n\n\u201cYeah, but let\u2019s not get that risky, especially since it\u2019s still the middle of the day and we haven\u2019t even gone to the arcade yet.\u201d I said as I put it back down and stood up. Kyler agreed and we walked off to continue our exploration.\n\nOnce we made it to the other end of the mall, we decided to head back to the Arcade and spend the rest of our day there, but almost immediately when we turned around, we saw a middle-aged guy with a mustache in uniform coming towards us on a segway. When he got off and approached us, he barked at us angrily, \u201cI know you two were trying to get into the theater!\u201d and before I could say sorry he pointed his fingers at the door and said, \u201cGet out!\u201d We didn\u2019t want to make a scene or get into any more trouble so we just said sorry and left the building. Needless to say, we were a little pissed off when we got outside, having our day cut abruptly and not even getting to go into the arcade. I understood where the security guard came from, I\u2019m sure he had kids constantly trying to sneak into the closed-off stores and he felt like he needed to just be blunt and kick out whoever got close to the line, but we had driven out an hour to get there and we spent about the same amount of time inside. Kyler wasn\u2019t having any of it though, and basically said, \u201cMan, that guy was an asshole.\u201d \n\nWe walked back to my car and since I did still feel bad about our trip being cut short, I asked Kyler if I should look up some nearby places for us to check out\u2014but he had another idea in mind. Without any hesitation, Kyler said, \u201cI wanna go back in there.\u201d\n\n\u201cKyler, no. If we go back in, he might call the cops and have us arrested.\u201d I replied, not wanting to jeopardize my college career by going to jail.\n\n\u201cNo we won\u2019t, if that guy could arrest us, he would\u2019ve done it right then and there.\u201d \n\n\u201cYeah, but he can still call the police and they can put us in cuffs. The guard told us to leave and I don\u2019t want to get in any more trouble.\u201d \n\n\u201cNo come on, you can\u2019t just live your life worrying about everything, you gotta take some risks and get some excitement. Besides, now that we\u2019ve been kicked out, the entire mall is now an equal playing field, including that theater.\u201d \n\nNone of my worries got through to him, and honestly, I half agreed with his viewpoint so that made it even harder to argue. Soon enough, I gave in, but I didn\u2019t want to just waltz back into the mall without a plan, and thankfully we were on the same page. So we decided to walk to a nearby supermarket and pick up some extra water bottles, some rubber gloves in case of broken glass, and a couple of face masks if there was black mold. After stashing it all in a backpack, we then got dinner at a nearby restaurant. While there, I pulled out my phone and started researching the mall to see if there were any helpful tips on places that were easy to sneak into and how to avoid security. I guess I shouldn\u2019t have been surprised that people weren\u2019t sharing trespassing tips online, but what I did find is that the Mall is actually a bit more strict than its empty interior would make you think. Multiple people posted about how the second security saw them not heading towards one of the two establishments, they\u2019d suddenly start popping up around every corner with their eyes on you. If you brought in a camera or even looked like you were gonna take a picture with your phone, they\u2019d kick you out of the mall without a warning. Come to think of it, I didn\u2019t see any security cameras around the whole place, yet when Kyler and I were at the cinema, there was no one around. Yet the guard almost immediately caught us a minute after we had left the theater, and there wasn\u2019t a trace of him before then. It was almost like he rode through a portal on that segway right in front of us. It was strange, whenever I went urban exploring, one of the factors that make it so chilling is the feeling that there could be someone watching you in this lost place you\u2019re trespassing on. With this mall that wasn\u2019t just a feeling, there *were* people there watching you, and apparently, they never took their eyes off you. \n\nBy the time Kyler and I got back to the mall, it was about 8 pm, the sun was starting to set and it\u2019d be about an hour before the arcade was scheduled to close, so the place was even emptier than usual. We opened up the door and made our way through the mall while trying to stick to the side and hide behind objects. Anytime we saw a security guard or heard footsteps that sounded close by, we\u2019d move either up or down the stairs to try and avoid them. During this time, I looked around to see if there were any security cameras, and to my surprise, I couldn\u2019t spot any of them. Not the classic box style ones nor the newer circular ones were in sight, and we went about halfway into the mall. Maybe they had cameras that were just so advanced they could camouflage with the rest of the building, but how could a mall that couldn\u2019t fix one of the many areas with water damage afford a security system that advanced? I\u2019ll admit, the mall was only more unsettling at night. Without the sun shining through the glass on the ceiling, it really showed how few lights were actually on in the building. The downstairs was almost completely unlit, and just about every hallway that went off the main path upstairs was pitch black. Luckily there was just enough light that we could navigate our way through the Mall without having to use our flashlights. But still, my heart was pounding as we went through the mall, and it felt like all the flying pig and fish sculptures were staring at me judgmentally whenever I glanced at one of them.\n\nWe finally reached the theater and the security gate was sticking above the ground just as we left it, and there wasn\u2019t anyone in our immediate vicinity so it seemed like this was the best chance we had if we were gonna go through with this. Approaching the security curtains, I lifted it up as Kyler slipped under, then held it for me so I could get in, dropping it after I was through. Quickly we moved to the walls to try to stay out of sight and began scanning the place for any leftover movie posters or standees we could pose with. There wasn\u2019t really anything we could see initially besides broken pieces of some of the tiles on the red floors, as well as some sort of mural of a movie camera with a film reel running through it. Truth be told, part of the reason we couldn\u2019t see much was that it was so dark, and we didn\u2019t want to turn on our flashlights so close to the entrance. \n\nBut seeing that mural did remind me that a bit past the concession stands, there was another piece of art past the concession stands that I saw when I went to this cinema with my Grandma almost a decade ago. I didn\u2019t remember much, just that it had a circle of film reels with a few pictures of famous actors in movies over it, like Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka, Pierce Brosnan as James Bond, and Halle Berry in I think the *Flintstones* movie. I wanted to see if that mural was still there and maybe if I could recognize all the actors and movies on it, so as I slid back and got to some stairs leading to the theater rooms, we sat down at the bottom and I took out my flashlight and shined it on the upper part of the wall. \n\nThe mural was right where I remembered it, but something about it felt\u2026 off. I thought maybe some of it was torn off, but it was more like someone painted over almost all of it. The only picture that was still visible was Halley Berry, but the rest of it had some sort of jet black muck all over, and everything it covered was completely gone. Worst of all was the odor it gave off, a strong bitter smell that reminded me of cough medicine. I turned to Kyler to see if I wasn\u2019t crazy, but he could see it too. He suggested that maybe it was mold, but I shot that down immediately. Not only does mold not smell like that, but even in places I explored that were abandoned since the 80s, the mold\u2019s color wasn\u2019t that strong or thick, and it normally spread in multiple dots of many different sizes, not one big blob you could fit a car into. Kyler reassured me that it was probably just some damage and it wouldn\u2019t be dangerous as long as we acted smart, so I swallowed and decided to head further in. Still, I was even more nervous than before about doing this, and I could feel my legs trembling as I stood up and walked. \n\nAs we got closer to the back, we looked down a hallway of doors to the individual theaters, some of them even still had the names of the movies that were playing in them. Though the feeling of \u2018*no way out\u2019* really struck me when I saw that there was nothing but a dead end on the other side of the hallway. Still, we wanted to go into the actual theaters since it was an area we couldn\u2019t see outside, so it might make for some cool pictures where security couldn\u2019t spot us. But we were still wary that the guards might be on to us, so we decided to go in shifts. While one of us would go into a screening room and look around, the other would stand by the edge of the hall and keep watch on the entrance. Then when one came back from the theater, they\u2019d watch the front while the other would explore another room. After that, we planned on getting out because we figured once you\u2019ve seen one screening room you\u2019ve seen them all. Kyler was the first one on guard duty, which means that I was the lucky winner of being the first to enter these dark dusty rooms by myself. Slipping the gloves and mask on, I took a deep breath and grabbed the cold door handle, and entered theater one. \n\nI didn\u2019t even wait for the door to close before I turned my flashlight on, I was too on edge to be in complete darkness. As I walked further into the seats and the screen, I looked around and everything looked about how I expected at first glance. All rows of seats were folded up and the stairs were covered in asbestos and more broken pieces of the ceiling. The screen was white and had mold hovering around the edges and the glass where the projector was supposed to be was shattered, almost looking like someone made off with it. The walls almost had the same black muck covering them as the mural, though these ended before they reached the lights. Though that foul odor was all the more apparent, and it made me almost want to hold my breath while I was in there. I walked further down in the hopes I could get an up-close look at the screen, but I suddenly stopped in between the two front rows when I felt something crack beneath my feet. I looked down and saw that I stepped on a pair of glasses, which felt strange because there were no soda cans, beer bottles, or other trash you\u2019d expect to find in an abandoned business. I shined my light down to the ground and my heart nearly sunk when I saw that it wasn\u2019t just the glasses, but there were also earrings, a pair of shoes, and even a hoodie with some jeans next to it. Was someone else in here and is now running around in the theater? What if they were attacked and after being knocked out they were stripped? I immediately turned, startled, shining my flashlight all over the room. I began shouting, \u201cHello! Is anyone there!?\u201d No one in sight. I began to feel a bit lightheaded and nauseous as if I was gonna faint. I tried to head back towards the door but I swayed to the side and my arm ran into the wall and\u2026 and\u2026 it began to sink. \n\nA tight squeeze gripped the front of my arm as I shined my light down and saw that the black muck had made it all the way to the bottom of the wall, and I was touching it. No, my forearm was straight up sinking in there like it was a pool of oil, and the smell was overwhelming at this point. My arm only sunk in further by the second, and soon enough it got my wrist. I lost all feeling in it. My hand just twitched as I gripped my fingers, but if I didn\u2019t act fast it\u2019d be next! I pressed my foot to the bottom of the wall and began pulling. No use, I could barely wiggle my shoulder in there, and now my palm had been fully overtaken. \u201cKYLER! KYLER HELP ME!\u201d I yelled out with all the energy I could muster. I screamed louder than I ever had in my life and I felt my lungs shrivel as I did. \u201cKYLER! I\u2019M SERIOUS MAN! *I\u2019M GONNA FUCKING DIE!*\u201d I coughed violently after bellowing out that last cry. My leg began to twitch and as I looked down, I saw my foot sinking into the same black sludge. I closed my eyes and felt tears streaming down my face. I just wanted to hang out with a friend for the day, trying to live the best years of my life. I didn\u2019t want to die, not now, I had so much ahead of me. Finishing school, getting to publish my work, and having a house and a family. All of it would be gone because I let Kyler convince me to do this. No\u2026 it wasn\u2019t Kyler\u2019s fault, he couldn\u2019t have known this would happen. It was my idea to come here. With tears still streaming down my face, I closed my eyes and allowed myself to sink into the wall\u2026\n\nThat\u2019s when I heard a loud bang from across the room and a beam of light forced my eyes open. Kyler came rushing in towards me as the gunk spread around the wall beside him, but he kept his eyes straight on me. \u201cWhat the hell is going on!?\u201d He yelled as he approached me. \u201cI don\u2019t know man, just get me out of here!\u201d I said with a wet and sweaty face as I held my free hand up towards him. By now my shoulder was almost in the wall and it would only be a matter of time before it got to my torso, or even worse, my face. Kyler grabbed my hand and began to pull, and I tried to help him by pushing with my free foot. It felt like I was barely moving an inch, and time was running out: my shoulder was already halfway through. Kyler grabbed one of his water bottles and splashed into the area my arm was in. It was probably a desperate attempt to try anything, but by some miracle, once the water was splashed on it, the muck actually began to recede. I began to fall out of the wall and I could feel my arm and foot again as I inched back into the room. Giving it one last tug, Kyler was able to pull me fully out, and as I fell into his arms, I hugged them tightly. \u201cOH MY GOD! THANK YOU! *THANK YOU!*\u201d I screamed for just a second as Kyler hugged back and we quickly let go. The black gunk was looming over us from the ceiling as a reminder that we were still in danger. I looked at my arm and saw that the sleeve of my shirt was missing, and not just torn. It was like it was cut off with perfect precision. Same with the front of my shoe, and the glove was completely gone. I didn\u2019t have time to think though, as Kyler tugged my arm and we both started running towards the exit. \n\nKicking the door open we made our way back to the exit, and now all the walls were completely encased in the black substance. The security curtain rattled as we almost crashed running into it. The mall outside was starting to turn off the lights, it looked like they were about to close. \u201cUh, dude, this thing isn\u2019t moving!\u201d Kyler yelled as he tugged at the bottom of the gate, it staying completely stagnant. I looked and saw the wall around the security curtain was covered in the black muck and it was now encasing it. I took out one of my water bottles and began splashing the side of the walls, hoping that would do the trick, but despite the muck dissipating again, the security curtain wasn\u2019t moving an inch vertically, we could only rattle it back and forth. I had to think fast, so I turned to Kyler and said, \u201cSplash as much water as you can on the walls and then let\u2019s step back to the concession stands. On three, we\u2019re going to charge!\u201d  I wasn\u2019t so sure of this plan myself, I was still shaking and shivering as I said each word, but Kyler just gave me a reassuring nod and splashed his side of the wall. He had faith in me, so I had to do the same.\n\nAfter I splashed my edge of the wall, we ran back as far as we could, the gunk still emerging around us, and we got into position. \u201cOne\u2026 *two*\u2026 ***THREE!***\u201d We both yelled as we charged at the gate with every bit of strength we had left in us. We crashed right through the security curtain and brought it down with us, our faces slammed right into the floor. I stood up as I felt a scratch on my chin, and Kyler had a bloody nose, but we didn\u2019t care. Scrambling to our feet, we sprinted straight towards the nearest exit. The muck began to creep into the mall behind us, but then suddenly stopped once it reached one of the parts of the roof with heavy water damage. I looked back and saw as I looked back to see the same security guard we ran into before just standing at the edge of the cinema, just watching us\u2026 \n\nThe doors banged against the wall as we came bursting out and sprinting through the parking lot. I hit the alarm on my car and it began to beep loudly, making it much easier to get to. We reached the car,  I unlocked the doors and we immediately sat down and buckled up. Once I switched the car on and put it into drive, I stomped on the gas and the engine roared as we sped out of the parking lot. We finally calmed down a bit as we made it onto the main road and began driving home, though both of us were panting heavily and couldn\u2019t even muster up enough breath to talk. Still, just looking at each other, we could see the trauma in our eyes as we tried to process just what any of that was! Where did it come from, why was it there? These were just some of the millions of questions we had going through our minds that we knew full well would never be answered. But at the very least, we were alive and safe, and that\u2019s all that mattered. \n\nIt\u2019s been a few years since that incident, and not only have I not gone back to that mall, I haven\u2019t really done much Urban Exploring in general. The pandemic turned me into a bit of a germaphobe, and between finishing up college, working a full-time job, and taking care of my own place, I just don\u2019t really have the time to research a place and then try to call someone up to explore it with for a few hours. Besides, I didn't want to have any panic attacks if I thought too much about that incident while I was exploring. Luckily it seems Kyler has fully recovered from this incident as well, and has been pursuing a career as a traveling photographer. We still hang out to this day, but when it comes to the incident, we rarely bring it up. We never told the police or anyone about it, fearing that the Mall may find out it was us and send their secret police after us or something. So for now we mainly just end the story after we got kicked out and left it at that. \n\n I still check on the mall online every once in a while, just to see if anyone saw the same thing as me and Kyler, as well as any new discoveries people may have found. Turns out the mall finally closed its doors and is actually going to be demolished in a few months, and in its place, they\u2019re going to build some apartments and office buildings. Maybe some people would think good riddance after what I went through, but I\u2019m honestly a little sad to see it go. Despite everything, I have a lot of memories of not only going to that mall, but also driving past it and wanting to check out the arcade, then finally getting that chance and finding a new appreciation for what that place had become in the years it spent in purgatory. Though honestly, I\u2019m also afraid. Whatever was in there, whatever had me, is it gone, or is it still around? Is it going to be able to snatch people while they\u2019re alone in their apartments, just small families ripped away from the earth in their own homes?! It makes me sick to my stomach just thinking about it, and it\u2019s not helping that this morning when I woke up, I noticed a spec of black muck on my arm\u2026,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/v51ajv/open_but_abandoned/,False"

"tifu,Psychomadeye,TIFU by napping after cooking dinner, It was my turn to cook and I made some tasty chili. My girlfriend is out of town so I used some dried peppers that I don't normally use because she can't handle the heat. I've started some new medication that makes me sleepy so I laid down for a nap afterwards. I got uncomfortable and had to adjust my penis. A couple seconds later it starts to itch, so I lightly manhandle the man candle to check if something is up. Big fucking mistake. I immediately understand what's happening (I didn't totally wash my hands of the peppers properly) and rush to the bathroom and run the shower as the burning starts to set in. I hop in the shower and the water is hot. This unfortunately is not what I need right now. It makes the burning ten times worse and I see stars. I'm turning the water down trying not to get any on me as the world turns white. I try to rinse again when the water is cold but nothing can convince my pyrocock to avert it's blaze. There are tears in my eyes as I fumble to get the showerhead off it's hook as General Sherman continues to burn his way across my south. I realize I have to pee and figure it might help. I couldn't have been more wrong. As the stream ends I feel fire start to run up my urethra. My vision goes white. It's brighter than the sun. Brighter than anything I've ever seen. I try to adjust the shower head settings while trying not to fall to my knees. Eventually the burning starts to ease and the water begins doing it's work. Occasionally drops of runoff from my hands leave streaks of fire in their wake but the water makes quick work of it. After a while I think I start to feel better and turn off the water. In less than ten seconds the burning is back and I almost fall trying to get out of the shower. I turn it back on and continue to rinse for another 15 minutes with tears in my eyes. \n\nTL;DR: I accidentally burned my dick with hot peppers.,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/v51biu/tifu_by_napping_after_cooking_dinner/,True"

"books,Gasp13579,Book about a boy with a chip in his brain.,Okay, so, a while ago, I read a book about a boy who had a chip in his brain. And this chip did nothing to him or his health, it was just there. Now, apparently, more people had chips in their brains and the ones that had them were going to be used for an experiment where they take another human and transfer the human\u2019s consciousness into the subject\u2019s (the person with the chip) brain. \n\nOne specific part that I remember is when something happens with a car and the boy can\u2019t remember the plate number. The girl whose consciousness was transferred into his brain remembers the plate number and yells it so many times that when she finally does it loud enough, he hears it and tells the police about the car.\n\nBy this time, the boy has realized that there is someone else in his brain, reading his thoughts and seeing everything he can see. He\u2019s disgusted and he asks his mom or aunt (I don\u2019t remember) about the chips and the experiments. (I think before he asked, the girl explained to him what was going on). \n\nThis is a fictional dystopian romance written mainly for teenagers. \n\nIf someone knows the name, please share it!,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/v51bqr/book_about_a_boy_with_a_chip_in_his_brain/,False"

"personalfinance,WhatItDoBabay11,Do present day long term capital gains rates make the tax advantages of a traditional 401k almost pointless?,The more I think about long term capital gains vs traditional 401ks, it seems kind of stupid that a regular taxed account gets substantially cheaper tax rates for long term holdings while a retirement account meant for long term holdings is taxed at ordinary income rates. How does that make any sense? I haven't run any numbers but it almost feels like the long term capital gains rates would be more advantageous for most vs  the pre tax contribution perk of a 401k. Am I wrong for thinking this?\n\nI always see people on this sub recommending to max out 401k if possible. Has anyone here run the numbers for a 30 year s&p investment of 401k vs regular account taxed at the long term rates? I'm growing more and more skeptical of the traditional 401k advantage. This is not financial advice, I'm just a bozo that's genuinely curious if anyone has ever run the numbers here. I feel that long term cap gains rates would probably outweigh pre-tax contribution perks (besides employer matches), but I'm not sure.

Congestion, headaches, runny nose, etc. I've experienced this before so I immediately bought some 12 hour pseudoephedrine as a decongestant. But it never went away, and the pain and swelling was still there on and off.\n\nI started taking ibuprofen on a regular basis. This is the part where I'm gonna sound like an idiot. Eventually I started using up to 10 a day every day. After a few weeks, my nose bridge started tingling. Not painfully, just strange. \n\nFast forward to last week. My wife and I are watching a movie. I feel like my nose is running. She looks a me and says hey your nose is bleeding! Not one of those little ones either. It just started dripping really fast.\n\nSo I reach for some paper towels... Probably went through 3 or 4 by the time I got it under control. I calm down. But for some reason I became nauseous (I probably swallowed a too much). Went to the restroom just in case. Throwing up opened the flood gates in my nose.

"personalfinance,JohnnyBoyJr,[Strategy] Investing in HSA funds to keep taxes simpler and the tax bill lower?,I recently found out I can transfer funds in my Health Savings Account (HSA) into a tax-exempt brokerage account (TD Ameritrade) and can invest in individual stocks - even some of those certain kind of funds that allow you to speculate in those online currencies...\nThe question: would it be tax-advantageous to invest in some of those complex/exotic tickers, such as Royalty Trusts and those that have somewhat complex structures?\nOr some of those stocks that pay large, but unqualified dividends?\nThere is a 20% penalty if you withdraw funds from a HSA. So instead of paying capital gains on share appreciation and/or dividends, wouldn't I be better off just being hit with a 20% penalty? (and in one sense, isn't this better than an IRA?). FYI: you can put a maximum of $3,650 into an individual HSA per year. So in my example: I dump $3,650 pre-tax into my HSA from my 1st paycheck of the year. The other option would be to dump $2,500 after-tax into my regular brokerage account. Either scenario would fully invest the $ amount into a stock that pays 10% dividend. The HSA return after 1 year would be $365 and a 20% withdrawal penalty ($73) The regular brokerage return would be $250 with a 30% tax hit ($75). So the difference would be $292 vs $175. Yes, in this example, it's 'only' a difference of $122, but then you don't have any complex taxes/paperwork, K-1's, etc.\nBut as far as the concept of using a HSA account as a type of tax shelter: any other upsides or downsides?,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/v51kny/strategy_investing_in_hsa_funds_to_keep_taxes/,False"

"nosleep,LadyBlackwood94,My Father Came back, \n\nMy father was a troubled man. He bounced from juvie to boys homes after being raised by an alcoholic father and an absent mother. He faced unspeakable horrors at the hands of his deadbeat dad. He did better with us than his dad did with him, but there\u2019s only improvement where my grandfathers parenting style is concerned. So he essentially terrorized us too, but less so. He had his demons; and that much was apparent growing up.\n\nMy father turned to drinking, and eventually opiates to ease the trauma of his early life, which only compounded his already erratic behavior. He did all manner of things while under the influence of whatever it was he was ingesting that day. Once, he barricaded himself in the house while my mom and I were out shopping with my siblings. We came home to find him brandishing a weapon; screaming about how \u201cthey were after him\u201d and \u201cit wasn\u2019t safe for us\u201d\n\nMy mom sent me in because \u201che listened to me better\u201d. And thus began my lifelong career of talking my dad out of his near constant crises. One by one, he abused them, and one by one, they left. All except me. It had been my job to care for him, after all. It was my responsibility to see him through it all. Even at the expense of my own safety. \n\nThen the big one came. After 25 years of tumultuous marriage, my mom finally left. I breathed a sign of relief as she frantically gathered her things with the help of a police escort, and my coaching of my dad to stay calm. I drove with my mom as she fled across the country to escape his clutches. All the while, on the phone with my dad, dodging his every question about her whereabouts. Thankfully, the drugs kept him from putting two and two together that I wasn\u2019t present for the same amount of time my mom was on the run. \n\nWhen I finally did return home he asked again where my mom was. \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know dad, she hasn\u2019t spoken to me since she stop speaking to you\u201d I said.\n\nHe just spoke one word; \u201ctraitor\u201d and shut the door in my face. I kept on with my life. I worked, I ate, I shit. Lather, rinse and repeat. It went on like this for weeks. Finally I got concerned. I took it upon myself to stop by the house. As I pulled up to the imposing block and wrought iron fence, I could feel the despondent quality of the atmosphere wash over me before I even entered. But something else was off. The lawn hadn\u2019t been watered or mowed in an indeterminate amount of time. The exterior of the house was\u2026.dusty. All of the curtains were drawn. \n\nMy parents were always good at keeping up appearances. You would never have been able to guess the horrors lurking inside that house just from looking at it. From the perfectly manicured lawn to the immaculate and spotlessly clean interior. They never allowed their children to look even slightly disheveled in hopes that no one would be able to guess the manner of unspeakable abuse we had to endure. \n\nOn multiple occasions, we were kicked out of the house on a hot summer day, with no shoes, no food, and no water. We were ordered to stay away from the house for an unknown amount of time so mom and dad could \u201ctalk\u201d. When we were finally allowed back in, mom was withdrawn, her tear streaked face pointed to the ground, afraid to make a sound, so as not to give away her \u201cimperfect\u201d life she had worked so hard to upkeep the illusion didn\u2019t exist. A piece of furniture was suspiciously removed after each these \u201ctalks\u201d most likely broken from the impact of my mothers body. And afterwards my moms body was all different shades of yellows, purples and greens. But we never spoke of it. None of us spoke of the personalized abuse we endured separately from each other. \n\nThe only conversation my mom and I had ever had about our shared / separate nightmare was one night in particular. We both got up from our respective beds around 2:30 A.M. we were both scared, without any knowledge why, and we both laid on each couch without a word to each other. We laid in silence for about a half an hour until our fear mounted to terror. I heard grunting and thumping coming from my parents room next door. We held hands in the dark, praying a silent plea of protection to whatever higher powers that be. We slept, holding onto each other and we awoke to the sun rising. Surprised surviving the night. We both commiserated on our shared experience. It felt as though there was pure evil in the next room, my parents room. It felt as though there were demons crawling up the walls. And if we moved even a millimeter, we would be facing a fatal consequence.\n\nMy mom instructed me to go into the room and check on my father, because I \u201ccould handle him better\u201d I walked in to find my dad fully clothed, lying on top of the bed sheets, surrounded by scraps of paper and plastic and fabric. As it turns out, my dad had spent the night cutting up my moms clothing, shredding all of her credit cards and identification documents and disconnecting the alarm system which conveniently had a panic button in the hallway next to the living room. I believe that the only reason we survived that night was due to our silent prayers.\n\nI shook myself out of my day dream. Dream? No, Nightmare. I reinforced my courage and steeled myself to make the short walk up the driveway to the house. I didn\u2019t have any house keys because my father never allowed anyone to have access to his house in fear that we would allow a stranger to come in and ransack the place, or that we would lose them in some parking lot and a criminal would be able to trace the generic master key back to him and come commit some unspeakable crime against him. The mind of childhood trauma speaks a different language than we do, I guess. \n\nAs I walked up the driveway, the house seemed to breathe. I could feel warmth and anger radiating from it. The imposing archway stood before me. I just had to walk underneath it. Right. Just walk underneath it. Simple. One final deep inhale to boost my courage and confidence, and I did just that. I knocked on the door. No answer. No noise came from inside the house. I knocked again, but louder. Nothing. I pushed the button for the doorbell, and as the Westminster chime rang I saw movement in the curtains. As I walked over to see if it was my father, peeking through them, probably in some state of paranoia, I was greeted my a pair of emerald green eyes that met my own. I jumped back in shock. \u201cWhat the fuck was that?\u201d I half screamed. Then came our family cat clawing at the window. She was frantic. Her usually fluffy white cheeks were sunken and her body looked as if it hadn\u2019t seen a meal in days.\n\nThis is when I knew something was deeply wrong. While my father was a monster to us; that cat was his pride and joy. She followed him everywhere. If I was good at talking him down from the ledge; she was a savant. Emma, the cat was a long haired mute calico cat who spent her days lying in the sun, being pampered by my father. All of us loved her, but there was an underlying jealousy there. Because we knew that my dad was capable of being tender and loving to something. Turns out it just wasn\u2019t us. I tapped on the window and said \u201cit\u2019s okay Emma! I\u2019ll come get you soon!\u201d\n\nAnd with that, I picked up my phone. I didn\u2019t know who I would call. I started with he police departments. Nothing. Then the morgues. Still nothing. And finally, after about the third hospital, I got a hit. He was there. They quickly connected me to his room after a brief shuffle of surprised overlapping voices. I can only assume that he wasn\u2019t exactly a walk in the park during his hospital stay and no one else had made any calls concerning him. \n\n\u201cHello?\u201d His husky voice spoke through the receiver.\n\n\u201cDad? Are you okay?\u201d I replied\n\n\u201cRache? Is that you?\u201d \n\n\u201cYeah dad, it\u2019s me. I\u2019m coming to see you. Just\u2026.stay put I guess.\u201d\n\nI arrived at the hospital room about 30 minutes later. As I walked into the room, I was overwhelmed with the sweet, sickly smell of a person who is actively dying. My nostrils were filled with the musky odor of kidney disease mixed with the sterile cleaning products used in a hospital. He looked like hell, too. His skin was swollen and discolored. He had a greasy yellow pallor to him. The whites of his eyes were ringed blood red and his irises were shrouded in the telltale yellow jaundice of renal failure. The next few minutes were a whirlwind of activity. Doctors and nurses came through. I don\u2019t remember most of it, but I do remember hearing words like \u201c end-of-life care\u201d and \u201cdialysis\u201d there were lots of sympathetic pats on the shoulders. And then it stopped. I was given a pile of pamphlets to read and the room was still again. \n\nI looked at my dad and asked \u201chow long have you been here?\u201d \n\n\u201cCouple days, maybe a week\u201d he said\n\n\u201cHas anyone been feeding Emma? Why didn\u2019t you call\u201d I replied\n\n\u201cNahh Emma\u2019s fine I\u2019m sure. Don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t call, just didn\u2019t\u201d he replied back.\n\nAfter nearly an hour of convincing, I finally got his keys back from him. After much reassurance of \u201cno I won\u2019t lose them\u201d \u201cno I won\u2019t let anyone else in\u201d and \u201cno I won\u2019t allow some machete wielding maniac to steal your shit\u201d he finally relented, and the only thing that really convinced him was the concern for that god damned cat. \n\nI went back to the house and awaited further instructions. As I entered the house, the stillness startled me. There\u2019s was always something going on here, some kind of hustle and bustle of day to day life. Whether it was arguing and objects clattering in the aftermath; or my mom frantically keeping the house as spotless as possible, there was always something. The only thing that stirred was the urging of Emma, letting me know that the food bowl had been empty for quite some time, and that the crystal glass on my fathers nightstand she drank from had long run dry. I dutifully gave her food and water and took a look around.\n\nAll the curtains were drawn and every light in the house was off. There were scent plug ins all around the house which were most likely put there to mask the sickness that hung over this place. But the scent of manufactured lavender was overwhelming, combined with the stale air inside the house. Cheap plastic vodka bottles littered the counter tops; stacks and stacks of mail was piled up. I looked at one, bills. Mom had always kept the finances on track so I\u2019m sure he was behind. He had always hid his drinking, but I guess he didn\u2019t feel the need to do that with everyone gone so he must have gone on one hell of a bender. After the years of abuse to his liver, I guess this one final bender did him in.\n\nMy phone rang, shocking me out of my reverie. \n\n\u201cHello?\u201d I answered.\n\n\u201cHey Rach, they want to send me home\u201d it was my dad.\n\n\u201cWhat? But\u2026 I thought there was all that talk of hospice? And dialysis?\u201d I replied, shocked. \n\n\u201cJust come fucking get me!\u201d He screamed on the other end \u201cI\u2019m sure Emma is missing me and I want to get the fuck out of here\u201d\n\nSo I did. I\u2019m sure he left that hospital AMA but I can only assume he was a huge pain in the ass while he was there and they were only happy to get rid of him. As I pulled up to the entrance, he sat alone in a wheelchair parked outside of the doors. They had rolled him out there and left him to sit alone to wait to be picked up. Classic dad move. Except he had ran these people off in record time. I brought him home and did my best to make him comfortable. I didn\u2019t know what I was doing or how to even care for him in this state. But I kept hearing the words overland over in my head \u201cyou know how to deal with him\u201d so I guess it was my job. I knew none of my siblings would come to his aid and I wouldn\u2019t dream of asking my mom to come back after her harrowing escape, so it was up to me. Tall order for someone who had just turned 18. But my mom didn\u2019t raise a quitter. \n\nAfter he was settled in, the house was cleaned up, the cat fed and his medications administered. I got a call. Teenage me still had obligations, right? \n\n\u201cDo you wanna come watch a movie with me?\u201d I heard the warmth of my best friends voice over the phone\n\nUncertainly I replied \u201cuhhhh\u2026 Sure. Just give me a few minutes and I\u2019ll be over\u201d\n\nI hung up and checked on my dad he was sleeping, fitfully. But sleeping. I whispered \u201cHey dad, I\u2019m gonna go watch a movie tonight. I won\u2019t be gone long\u201d\n\nHe sputtered out a weak \u201cokay\u201d\n\nAnd I left.\n\nThe night went on as usual. I filled my friend in on the happenings with my mom leaving and my dad apparently dying. She offered her support and we settled in to watch Thor. Somewhere along the way, I fell asleep. I awoke in a panic to sunshine filtering in. I got home as fast as I could. I frantically began doing whatever monotonous household chores I could think of to stave off his anger at me being out all night without asking. And then I remembered, he is a dying man in the next room. A dying man that i\u2019d better go check on.\n\nI tiptoed into his room; still afraid at his reaction, though I knew there wasn\u2019t much he could do. The man could barely walk, but old habits die hard I guess. He wasn\u2019t in his bed. I kept walking into his room, a room I was so rarely allowed in. It felt like I was committing a crime just being in there. And then I saw him. He was lying face down the cat lying at his feet. As I got closer I saw that his head was wedged between his large wooden nightstand and his bed frame. His arm was bent upwards with the bedsheets still clutched tight in his hands. As if he were trying to get himself back up off the ground. His other arm lay at his side. I rushed to his side and slammed my palm into his back repeatedly, as you would a choking toddler. Hollow. I went to his ankles to try and pull him out from between the furniture. My hands clasped around his swollen, purple ankles. As I gripped, my fingers left deep depressions in his ankles, as if he were made of play- doh. Cold. He was cold. My last resort. I moved the nightstand away from his head and tried to roll him on his back.\n\nHis body stayed rigid and in the exact same position it had been as it was resting against the bed. Arm bent, face down on the carpet. His face kept the same shape as it had been while smashed against the floor. Blood poured from his mouth, eyes, nose and ear closest to the ground and the blood inside his body had pooled to the lowest point, leaving his disfigured face, swollen and purple. His clouded eyes stared at me as if to say \u201cyou let me die alone\u201d I left him there, face down.\n\nMy only option was to dial 911. I could barely hear the dial tone of the phone. It sounded like someone far away was talking to me. \n\n\u201c911, what is the location of your emergency?\u201d\n\n\u201cHello? 911? Where are you located?\u201d\n\nI heard the sudden hiss of air escaping lungs. My head snapped over to my father a few feet away. Was he\u2026.breathing? No. I checked for a pulse. There\u2019s shit in his pants, what the fuck? What. The. Fuck. I could hear cracking as I watched his head began to turn. I clutched phone at my side, operator still calling out for someone. His head turned, and turned until it faced me directly. The bones snapped and tendons groaned in protest. Then he began to stand. Still in the same position as before. He rose in irregular, jerking motions. He grunted and gurgled at me. I stood motionless. Unable to move or make a sound out of pure terror. He began to make his way towards me. The swollen, discolored thing that was once my father. His arm still bent. Face still smashed and purple with coagulated blood gathered around it. He twitched and jolted his disfigured body towards me. The room grew dark with evil. The walls faded away until it felt like they were a thousand miles displaced in every direction. I was surrounded by an immeasurable darkness. And then he stopped \n\nHe spoke with several voices behind his own, high pitched, bass toned, childlike. And he said two words \u201cyou. Traitor\u201d\n\nThen my trance was broken, and the fear that had rendered me immobile just moments before had lent me the strength to run. He screamed after me. But I ran. I kept running. \n\nI don\u2019t remember much after that. But I do know that police showed up. I know his body was hauled away. And I know I moved out of state shortly after that. My life since then has been a series of waiting rooms and therapists. Talking and talking and talking. They seem to believe what I went through was some sort of \u201cstress induced psychosis\u201d and I choose to believe them. It\u2019s much easier than believing that any of that was actually real.\n\nI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s true. But I do know that on nights when I\u2019m alone, and the house is dark. I\u2019ll see him. The gnarled and deform shape of my dead father. Lurking to get revenge on his traitor of a daughter. Maybe one day he might get me. Or maybe this is his form of revenge.

I joined the military as that was the quickest way out of that terrible bible thumping town I grew up in. I wasn't allowed to have friends from other races or religious backgrounds. Honestly I wasn't even allowed to use the term \"black person\" or \"African American\". If I had friends from other races they were the enemy and I had to learn the \"n word\".   That was the only acceptable term growing up. They had this mindset that certain were black because of some kind of punishment from God. \nAnyway. I married the woman of my dreams recently. The most amazing person I think I will ever meet. She is a black woman.  Doesn't make a difference to me. She's my wife and the one I will always hold dear to me. I told my family that I got married. Then I told them it was to a black woman. They do not accept it as a legitimate marriage. Their loss. Not my problem. \nFor those of you out there interracial, gay, lesbian, trans, etc...  \nWe don't need those people in our lives.

"nosleep,SuperCharmander1,Open But Abandoned,I\u2019ve always had a fascination with Urban Exploring, or as my Mom calls it, walking around in abandoned moldy buildings. While that may be true, it\u2019s still an activity I like to partake in every once in a while, and what makes it such an exhilarating experience is the feeling you get while you\u2019re there. It\u2019s hard to describe, but something about seeing a place that was once bustling and full of activity, whether it be a house, a factory, or a hospital, now sit empty and decaying as nature and graffiti take over. You\u2019re overcome with emotions you\u2019ve never felt before. It\u2019s almost like looking into the mind of a dead person, if that makes any sense. The other thing is you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re gonna see while you explore an abandoned place. Maybe you\u2019ll find some old newspapers or books, come across some interesting graffiti; hell, one guy found discarded costumes and props from Pokemon Live while in a theater. At the same time, you don\u2019t know what dangers you may come across. Mold, asbestos, weak floors that\u2019ll cave in when you step on them, or maybe even a trio of mutant cannibals! There\u2019s a constant chill running down your back and the feeling that you\u2019re not supposed to be there, and yet your curiosity makes you try to explore every inch of the place before you leave. I could go on and on about the various adventures my friends and I have had while urban exploring, but there's one place that\u2019ll always stick out in my mind. A place that was so fascinating to explore not just because of the interesting architecture and statues everywhere, but because despite being empty and abandoned, it\u2019s actually still open.\n\nThe place in question is a mall, which goes by many names, but for the sake of making sure none of you seek out and find this place, I\u2019ll simply just be calling it the mall. Opened in the late 80s, the Mall was once one of the coolest places to go for kids of all ages. For younger kids, there were plenty of playsets and daycare places they could run around in, and for older kids, there was an arcade and a movie theater. Overall it was just a fun and colorful place to explore. The building had a light blue color scheme that\u2019s supposed to simulate being under the sea, and to add to that there are sculptures of various fish and coral hanging from the ceiling. But that isn\u2019t all to the theming, because there\u2019s also a gazebo with golden flying pigs standing atop its sides by the fountain, and some farm animals placed by entrances to the stores in the back. I imagine that it was a great hangout spot for those growing up in the radical 90s. I say imagine because I\u2019m a 2000s kid, and I lived about an hour away from the Mall, so I didn\u2019t really get to go to it that often, especially when it was in its prime. The only time I recall going there as a kid was when my Grandma took me to see *Puss in Boots*, and I remember walking past the Arcade and seeing *Marvel vs. Capcom 2*, a game I had heard legendary things about, and I so wanted to go in there and check out everything they had! But unfortunately, my Grandma didn\u2019t want to stand around for a few hours while I ran around playing the games, so I could only glance at the windows. But I remember thinking that once I was old enough to drive and got my license, I\u2019d gather up my friends and we\u2019d spend the whole day at that arcade!\n\nBut when that time came and I returned to the mall, I remember arriving in the empty parking lot, seeing the colors and pictures by the entrance all faded from the sun. When I went in, I found nothing but an empty building full of closed stores. I remember thinking to myself, \u201cIs this place even open?\u201d but lo and behold, the door was unlocked, the lights were on, and there were a couple of people just wandering the place. Still, it felt like I was walking into some horror game, and just around the corner there\u2019d be zombies I\u2019d have to start shooting. When I say this place was nearly dead, I mean it! Every restaurant in the food court, closed! All the kiosks, gone! Almost every store in the mall was boarded up or gated off, and that wasn\u2019t the only thing that made the place feel dead. The fountain was now shut off and sat empty, the escalators sat still, the candy in the gumball machines looked stale and gross, and there were multiple sections of the ceiling that showed devastating water damage. The only thing the staff did to deal with it was put some buckets under the leakage, which sometimes overflowed and spilled all over the floor. There were only two places in the mall that were even open. One was a Bass Pro Shop that was just connected to the mall and might as well have been a different building, and, luckily for me and my friends: The arcade was still up and running.\n\nSo at the very least, I could fulfill the dreams of my childhood self, and one day I took a group of my friends to that Mall, and we spent the whole afternoon in that arcade playing *Marvel Vs. Capcom 2, Ninja Turtles, Alien 3,* and even a Japanese rhythm game that had anime openings on its soundtrack. We were able to do all of that and more for just 10 bucks each. It was a moment where we got to let go of our worries and just enjoy life for a few hours, and I\u2019ll treasure it for the rest of my life.\n\nWhen I got older and went off to college, I started to become fascinated with urban exploring, and whenever I went to an abandoned mansion or school, I always thought back to the mall because the state it was left in oftentimes didn\u2019t look too different from some of the places I checked out. I wanted to go back there again with this new mindset, instead of heading straight to the arcade I wanted to just walk all around the mall and just see what I could find. Now the number one rule of Urban Exploring is to never go alone! On top of the fact that you may need a friend in case you fall or get hurt, it\u2019s also nice to have someone to bounce off of while you\u2019re there. So during the summer break, I recruited my good friend, Kyler, and after packing some water bottles and flashlights, we headed straight for the Mall. Our plan was to generally take a walk all around the inside of the mall and see what it was like, then we\u2019d end the day by winding down at the arcade before leaving. Trust me when I say, I wish it was that mundane and normal.\n\nWhen we first arrived, I remember being super excited to show Kyler all around the place, since he couldn\u2019t make it the day my friends and I spent the afternoon there, so it\u2019d be cool to try and show him around. We were also both big fighting game fanatics, so I was itching to kick his ass in a few rounds of *Marvel vs. Capcom 2*. But ignoring that, we were both interested to see just how dead the mall was and if there were some interesting surprises or treasures to find. When we first walked in and passed the gumball machines filled with musty candy, we were still in awe as to how such a dead-looking place could be open. One of the first things Kyler said early into our exploration was, \u201cYou know one day we should bring a whole group of people here, and we should play hide and seek.\u201d I laughed and said it was a great idea and was secretly planning out some good hiding spots while we were there. Surprisingly enough, there were a handful of people still walking around the mall, often just taking a walk in a place with air conditioning, or sitting down at a bench reading a book. I guess it would be a pretty cool place to go if you just wanted some peace and quiet because there was hardly any talking and no music playing throughout the entire place; you could hear a raindrop hit the ceiling.\n\nOther than the Arcade and the playground, there really wasn\u2019t much of note that Kyler and I found unless you counted looking at blacked-out windows of closed stores. There was a place that looked like a bar that had nothing stopping you from climbing over the surprisingly short railings, but it looked basically empty so we passed it by. However, when we came across the movie theater, things got a little bit interesting. The outside had still had the labels for the last movies that played there, and though there was a security curtain blocking the entrance, you could still look inside and see the box office, concession stands, and the paths to the theaters. I could\u2019ve sworn I saw someone around the corner but it was too dark to really be able to tell. But on top of everything else, the security curtain wasn\u2019t actually touching the floor, and we could even slip our toes under it. After experimenting with how far we could stick our feet in there, Kyler got down on his knees and actually reached his arm in the theater. When pulling it back, he bumped the security curtain and it actually moved up a little bit.\n\n\u201cDude, I think this thing is a bit loose!\u201d Kyler said ecstatically.\n\n\u201cReally, I wonder how far it goes up.\u201d I said as I kneeled down next to him and grabbed the gate. I lifted it and though it got stuck after a few inches, it still was a big enough gap that the both of us could easily slip through.\n\n\u201cAw man, someone could easily get back in there if they wanted to.\u201d Kyler half-joked as he stood up.\n\n\u201cYeah, but let\u2019s not get that risky, especially since it\u2019s still the middle of the day and we haven\u2019t even gone to the arcade yet.\u201d I said as I put it back down and stood up. Kyler agreed and we walked off to continue our exploration.\n\nOnce we made it to the other end of the mall, we decided to head back to the Arcade and spend the rest of our day there, but almost immediately when we turned around, we saw a middle-aged guy with a mustache in uniform coming towards us on a segway. When he got off and approached us, he barked at us angrily, \u201cI know you two were trying to get into the theater!\u201d and before I could say sorry he pointed his fingers at the door and said, \u201cGet out!\u201d We didn\u2019t want to make a scene or get into any more trouble so we just said sorry and left the building. Needless to say, we were a little pissed off when we got outside, having our day cut abruptly and not even getting to go into the arcade. I understood where the security guard came from, I\u2019m sure he had kids constantly trying to sneak into the closed-off stores and he felt like he needed to just be blunt and kick out whoever got close to the line, but we had driven out an hour to get there and we spent about the same amount of time inside. Kyler wasn\u2019t having any of it though, and basically said, \u201cMan, that guy was an asshole.\u201d\n\nWe walked back to my car and since I did still feel bad about our trip being cut short, I asked Kyler if I should look up some nearby places for us to check out\u2014but he had another idea in mind. Without any hesitation, Kyler said, \u201cI wanna go back in there.\u201d\n\n\u201cKyler, no. If we go back in, he might call the cops and have us arrested.\u201d I replied, not wanting to jeopardize my college career by going to jail.\n\n\u201cNo we won\u2019t, if that guy could arrest us, he would\u2019ve done it right then and there.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, but he can still call the police and they can put us in cuffs. The guard told us to leave and I don\u2019t want to get in any more trouble.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo come on, you can\u2019t just live your life worrying about everything, you gotta take some risks and get some excitement. Besides, now that we\u2019ve been kicked out, the entire mall is now an equal playing field, including that theater.\u201d\n\nNone of my worries got through to him, and honestly, I half agreed with his viewpoint so that made it even harder to argue. Soon enough, I gave in, but I didn\u2019t want to just waltz back into the mall without a plan, and thankfully we were on the same page. So we decided to walk to a nearby supermarket and pick up some extra water bottles, some rubber gloves in case of broken glass, and a couple of face masks if there was black mold. After stashing it all in a backpack, we then got dinner at a nearby restaurant. While there, I pulled out my phone and started researching the mall to see if there were any helpful tips on places that were easy to sneak into and how to avoid security. I guess I shouldn\u2019t have been surprised that people weren\u2019t sharing trespassing tips online, but what I did find is that the Mall is actually a bit more strict than its empty interior would make you think. Multiple people posted about how the second security saw them not heading towards one of the two establishments, they\u2019d suddenly start popping up around every corner with their eyes on you. If you brought in a camera or even looked like you were gonna take a picture with your phone, they\u2019d kick you out of the mall without a warning. \n\nCome to think of it, I didn\u2019t see any security cameras around the whole place, yet when Kyler and I were at the cinema, there was no one around. Yet the guard almost immediately caught us a minute after we had left the theater, and there wasn\u2019t a trace of him before then. It was almost like he rode through a portal on that segway right in front of us. It was strange, whenever I went urban exploring, one of the factors that make it so chilling is the feeling that there could be someone watching you in this lost place you\u2019re trespassing on. With this mall that wasn\u2019t just a feeling, there *were* people there watching you, and apparently, they never took their eyes off you.\n\nBy the time Kyler and I got back to the mall, it was about 8 pm, the sun was starting to set and it\u2019d be about an hour before the arcade was scheduled to close, so the place was even emptier than usual. We opened up the door and made our way through the mall while trying to stick to the side and hide behind objects. Anytime we saw a security guard or heard footsteps that sounded close by, we\u2019d move either up or down the stairs to try and avoid them. During this time, I looked around to see if there were any security cameras, and to my surprise, I couldn\u2019t spot any of them. Not the classic box style ones nor the newer circular ones were in sight, and we went about halfway into the mall. Maybe they had cameras that were just so advanced they could camouflage with the rest of the building, but how could a mall that couldn\u2019t fix one of the many areas with water damage afford a security system that advanced? I\u2019ll admit, the mall was only more unsettling at night. Without the sun shining through the glass on the ceiling, it really showed how few lights were actually on in the building. The downstairs was almost completely unlit, and just about every hallway that went off the main path upstairs was pitch black. Luckily there was just enough light that we could navigate our way through the Mall without having to use our flashlights. But still, my heart was pounding as we went through the mall, and it felt like all the flying pig and fish sculptures were staring at me judgmentally whenever I glanced at one of them.\n\nWe finally reached the theater and the security gate was sticking above the ground just as we left it, and there wasn\u2019t anyone in our immediate vicinity so it seemed like this was the best chance we had if we were gonna go through with this. Approaching the security curtains, I lifted it up as Kyler slipped under, then held it for me so I could get in, dropping it after I was through. Quickly we moved to the walls to try to stay out of sight and began scanning the place for any leftover movie posters or standees we could pose with. There wasn\u2019t really anything we could see initially besides broken pieces of some of the tiles on the red floors, as well as some sort of mural of a movie camera with a film reel running through it. Truth be told, part of the reason we couldn\u2019t see much was that it was so dark, and we didn\u2019t want to turn on our flashlights so close to the entrance.\n\nBut seeing that mural did remind me that a bit past the concession stands, there was another piece of art past the concession stands that I saw when I went to this cinema with my Grandma almost a decade ago. I didn\u2019t remember much, just that it had a circle of film reels with a few pictures of famous actors in movies over it, like Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka, Pierce Brosnan as James Bond, and Halle Berry in I think the *Flintstones* movie. I wanted to see if that mural was still there and maybe if I could recognize all the actors and movies on it, so as I slid back and got to some stairs leading to the theater rooms, we sat down at the bottom and I took out my flashlight and shined it on the upper part of the wall.\n\nThe mural was right where I remembered it, but something about it felt\u2026 off. I thought maybe some of it was torn off, but it was more like someone painted over almost all of it. The only picture that was still visible was Halley Berry, but the rest of it had some sort of jet black muck all over, and everything it covered was completely gone. Worst of all was the odor it gave off, a strong bitter smell that reminded me of cough medicine. I turned to Kyler to see if I wasn\u2019t crazy, but he could see it too. He suggested that maybe it was mold, but I shot that down immediately. Not only does mold not smell like that, but even in places I explored that were abandoned since the 80s, the mold\u2019s color wasn\u2019t that strong or thick, and it normally spread in multiple dots of many different sizes, not one big blob you could fit a car into. Kyler reassured me that it was probably just some damage and it wouldn\u2019t be dangerous as long as we acted smart, so I swallowed and decided to head further in. Still, I was even more nervous than before about doing this, and I could feel my legs trembling as I stood up and walked.\n\nAs we got closer to the back, we looked down a hallway of doors to the individual theaters, some of them even still had the names of the movies that were playing in them. Though the feeling of \u2018*no way out\u2019* really struck me when I saw that there was nothing but a dead end on the other side of the hallway. Still, we wanted to go into the actual theaters since it was an area we couldn\u2019t see outside, so it might make for some cool pictures where security couldn\u2019t spot us. But we were still wary that the guards might be on to us, so we decided to go in shifts. While one of us would go into a screening room and look around, the other would stand by the edge of the hall and keep watch on the entrance. Then when one came back from the theater, they\u2019d watch the front while the other would explore another room. After that, we planned on getting out because we figured once you\u2019ve seen one screening room you\u2019ve seen them all. Kyler was the first one on guard duty, which means that I was the lucky winner of being the first to enter these dark dusty rooms by myself. Slipping the gloves and mask on, I took a deep breath and grabbed the cold door handle, and entered theater one.\n\nI didn\u2019t even wait for the door to close before I turned my flashlight on, I was too on edge to be in complete darkness. As I walked further into the seats and the screen, I looked around and everything looked about how I expected at first glance. All rows of seats were folded up and the stairs were covered in asbestos and more broken pieces of the ceiling. The screen was white and had mold hovering around the edges and the glass where the projector was supposed to be was shattered, almost looking like someone made off with it. The walls almost had the same black muck covering them as the mural, though these ended before they reached the lights. Though that foul odor was all the more apparent, and it made me almost want to hold my breath while I was in there. I walked further down in the hopes I could get an up-close look at the screen, but I suddenly stopped in between the two front rows when I felt something crack beneath my feet. I looked down and saw that I stepped on a pair of glasses, which felt strange because there were no soda cans, beer bottles, or other trash you\u2019d expect to find in an abandoned business. I shined my light down to the ground and my heart nearly sunk when I saw that it wasn\u2019t just the glasses, but there were also earrings, a pair of shoes, and even a hoodie with some jeans next to it. Was someone else in here and is now running around in the theater? What if they were attacked and after being knocked out they were stripped? I immediately turned, startled, shining my flashlight all over the room. I began shouting, \u201cHello! Is anyone there!?\u201d No one in sight. I began to feel a bit lightheaded and nauseous as if I was gonna faint. I tried to head back towards the door but I swayed to the side and my arm ran into the wall and\u2026 and\u2026 it began to sink.\n\nA tight squeeze gripped the front of my arm as I shined my light down and saw that the black muck had made it all the way to the bottom of the wall, and I was touching it. No, my forearm was straight up sinking in there like it was a pool of oil, and the smell was overwhelming at this point. My arm only sunk in further by the second, and soon enough it got my wrist. I lost all feeling in it. My hand just twitched as I gripped my fingers, but if I didn\u2019t act fast it\u2019d be next! I pressed my foot to the bottom of the wall and began pulling. No use, I could barely wiggle my shoulder in there, and now my palm had been fully overtaken. \u201cKYLER! KYLER HELP ME!\u201d I yelled out with all the energy I could muster. I screamed louder than I ever had in my life and I felt my lungs shrivel as I did. \u201cKYLER! I\u2019M SERIOUS MAN! *I\u2019M GONNA FUCKING DIE!*\u201d I coughed violently after bellowing out that last cry. My leg began to twitch and as I looked down, I saw my foot sinking into the same black sludge. I closed my eyes and felt tears streaming down my face. I just wanted to hang out with a friend for the day, trying to live the best years of my life. I didn\u2019t want to die, not now, I had so much ahead of me. Finishing school, getting to publish my work, and having a house and a family. All of it would be gone because I let Kyler convince me to do this. No\u2026 it wasn\u2019t Kyler\u2019s fault, he couldn\u2019t have known this would happen. It was my idea to come here. With tears still streaming down my face, I closed my eyes and allowed myself to sink into the wall\u2026\n\nThat\u2019s when I heard a loud bang from across the room and a beam of light forced my eyes open. Kyler came rushing in towards me as the gunk spread around the wall beside him, but he kept his eyes straight on me. \u201cWhat the hell is going on!?\u201d He yelled as he approached me. \u201cI don\u2019t know man, just get me out of here!\u201d I said with a wet and sweaty face as I held my free hand up towards him. By now my shoulder was almost in the wall and it would only be a matter of time before it got to my torso, or even worse, my face. Kyler grabbed my hand and began to pull, and I tried to help him by pushing with my free foot. It felt like I was barely moving an inch, and time was running out: my shoulder was already halfway through. Kyler grabbed one of his water bottles and splashed into the area my arm was in. It was probably a desperate attempt to try anything, but by some miracle, once the water was splashed on it, the muck actually began to recede. I began to fall out of the wall and I could feel my arm and foot again as I inched back into the room. Giving it one last tug, Kyler was able to pull me fully out, and as I fell into his arms, I hugged them tightly. \u201cOH MY GOD! THANK YOU! *THANK YOU!*\u201d I screamed for just a second as Kyler hugged back and we quickly let go. The black gunk was looming over us from the ceiling as a reminder that we were still in danger. I looked at my arm and saw that the sleeve of my shirt was missing, and not just torn. It was like it was cut off with perfect precision. Same with the front of my shoe, and the glove was completely gone. I didn\u2019t have time to think though, as Kyler tugged my arm and we both started running towards the exit.\n\nKicking the door open we made our way back to the exit, and now all the walls were completely encased in the black substance. The security curtain rattled as we almost crashed running into it. The mall outside was starting to turn off the lights, it looked like they were about to close. \u201cUh, dude, this thing isn\u2019t moving!\u201d Kyler yelled as he tugged at the bottom of the gate, it staying completely stagnant. I looked and saw the wall around the security curtain was covered in the black muck and it was now encasing it. I took out one of my water bottles and began splashing the side of the walls, hoping that would do the trick, but despite the muck dissipating again, the security curtain wasn\u2019t moving an inch vertically, we could only rattle it back and forth. I had to think fast, so I turned to Kyler and said, \u201cSplash as much water as you can on the walls and then let\u2019s step back to the concession stands. On three, we\u2019re going to charge!\u201d I wasn\u2019t so sure of this plan myself, I was still shaking and shivering as I said each word, but Kyler just gave me a reassuring nod and splashed his side of the wall. He had faith in me, so I had to do the same.\n\nAfter I splashed my edge of the wall, we ran back as far as we could, the gunk still emerging around us, and we got into position. \u201cOne\u2026 *two*\u2026 ***THREE!***\u201d We both yelled as we charged at the gate with every bit of strength we had left in us. We crashed right through the security curtain and brought it down with us, our faces slammed right into the floor. I stood up as I felt a scratch on my chin, and Kyler had a bloody nose, but we didn\u2019t care. Scrambling to our feet, we sprinted straight towards the nearest exit. The muck began to creep into the mall behind us, but then suddenly stopped once it reached one of the parts of the roof with heavy water damage. I looked back and saw as I looked back to see the same security guard we ran into before just standing at the edge of the cinema, just watching us\u2026\n\nThe doors banged against the wall as we came bursting out and sprinting through the parking lot. I hit the alarm on my car and it began to beep loudly, making it much easier to get to. We reached the car, I unlocked the doors and we immediately sat down and buckled up. Once I switched the car on and put it into drive, I stomped on the gas and the engine roared as we sped out of the parking lot. We finally calmed down a bit as we made it onto the main road and began driving home, though both of us were panting heavily and couldn\u2019t even muster up enough breath to talk. Still, just looking at each other, we could see the trauma in our eyes as we tried to process just what any of that was! Where did it come from, why was it there? These were just some of the millions of questions we had going through our minds that we knew full well would never be answered. But at the very least, we were alive and safe, and that\u2019s all that mattered.\n\nIt\u2019s been a few years since that incident, and not only have I not gone back to that mall, I haven\u2019t really done much Urban Exploring in general. The pandemic turned me into a bit of a germaphobe, and between finishing up college, working a full-time job, and taking care of my own place, I just don\u2019t really have the time to research a place and then try to call someone up to explore it with for a few hours. Besides, I didn't want to have any panic attacks if I thought too much about that incident while I was exploring. Luckily it seems Kyler has fully recovered from this incident as well, and has been pursuing a career as a traveling photographer. We still hang out to this day, but when it comes to the incident, we rarely bring it up. We never told the police or anyone about it, fearing that the Mall may find out it was us and send their secret police after us or something. So for now we mainly just end the story after we got kicked out and left it at that.\n\nI still check on the mall online every once in a while, just to see if anyone saw the same thing as me and Kyler, as well as any new discoveries people may have found. Turns out the mall finally closed its doors and is actually going to be demolished in a few months, and in its place, they\u2019re going to build some apartments and office buildings. Maybe some people would think good riddance after what I went through, but I\u2019m honestly a little sad to see it go. Despite everything, I have a lot of memories of not only going to that mall, but also driving past it and wanting to check out the arcade, then finally getting that chance and finding a new appreciation for what that place had become in the years it spent in purgatory. Though honestly, I\u2019m also afraid. Whatever was in there, whatever had me, is it gone, or is it still around? Is it going to be able to snatch people while they\u2019re alone in their apartments, just small families ripped away from the earth in their own homes?! It makes me sick to my stomach just thinking about it, and it\u2019s not helping that this morning when I woke up, I noticed a spec of black muck on my arm\u2026,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/v51xsh/open_but_abandoned/,False"

"nosleep,Temporary_Pilot_4915,Boxes keep on showing up at my doorstep and getting me into trouble, and I think something wants to kill me,When I was little, the only things I were afraid of were clowns and the dark. The list has [significantly expanded](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/v3f8ue/i_answered_a_phone_call_and_it_was_the_worst/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), and I don\u2019t think any homeowner\u2019s associations will be putting me on their Facebook pages for a while now. Between you and me, though, it\u2019s more the porches I\u2019m scared of. \n\nMost people have their own share of phobias or fears\u2013and I would think that those fears would also expand if you found out that someone that you didn\u2019t know had somehow obtained your address, delivered a suspicious packet, and then called you up yelling about emotional distress. I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a word for a phobia of break-ins, though. And with the amount of Googling I\u2019ve been doing in general, I don\u2019t particularly want to look it up. Let me know if there is such a word though.\n\nAnyways, Mr. and Mrs. P were reasonably unsettled when they came back from Florida, and we all arranged to meet up at the police station to report someone breaking into their house. I didn\u2019t mention all of the *other* stuff because the police would probably think I was a lunatic or on drugs, and I wasn\u2019t in the mood to get laughed at again.\n\nAs soon as the complaint was filed, we all piled into our cars: well, the officer went into his car, and since Mr. and Mrs. P had gotten a taxi, I just offered to drive them. I think we had a little bit of mutual trust between us given the absolute shitshow that the past two days had been, and so it was a good half-an-hour drive to the house. \n\nWe stayed in the car while the officer checked it out for a few minutes. When he came back outside, he had an odd look on his face. \u201cWell, no one\u2019s in there at the moment and nothing looks too disturbed, so I\u2019d advise y\u2019all to get a new alarm and camera system, and tighten up some locks.\u201d Then he hesitated a little and laughed, \u201cYou certainly have a big house, ma\u2019am.\u201d\n\nThere was an awkward moment when I was like *oh no it\u2019s not my house it\u2019s theirs,* and he was like *oh I thought you were just their kid* and then Mrs. P was like *oh no we only met recently* and the officer scratched his head and we all laughed awkwardly. He drove off and we were all stuck in a cul-de-sac until I remembered how to get out of a reverse parallel parking and started driving again.\n\n\u201cOne thing\u2026\u201d Mr. P said. \u201cOur house is very small and homely, though.\u201d\n\nWell, certainly none of us were willing to check. Both of them booked a hotel for the next few nights, and I got them to look into all this with me\u2013I think the part that really influenced them was not really having a choice, though.\n\nThe next morning, we started with the basics. I was in my Sherlock Holmes zone, which meant I just asked them a lot of questions and they grilled me like I was barbeque. It.. was a mutual interrogation.\n\nHere\u2019s what we found out: the only people Mr. and Mrs. P had beef with was Mr. P\u2019s family like ten years ago when they got married because his mom didn\u2019t like Mrs. P, and the list of people I had probably pissed off was *very* long. So there was probably\u2013scratch that, definitely\u2013someone with a reason why. I told Mr. P that if it was any consolation, it likely wasn\u2019t his family that was involved with this. So then it came down to me. Whoever had done this obviously was either A and Mister Motherfucking Casino, or else A, Mister Motherfucking Casino, and one of their cronies. Friends. Whatever.\n\nAdditionally, I was the only one of us who was *not* superstitious. They had a family curse or something (they wouldn\u2019t tell me the specifics, which I get) and they were probably hiding something, but whatever the situation was, it was pretty terrifying. \n\nSo, with this information, Mrs. P reasoned through a mouthful of spaghetti, we had to figure out why: a) their house was the target for this whole thing, b) what was in the box and who picked it up, and c) where we fit into this.  Google became our best friend.\n\nActually, it had already been my best friend. Before my whole stint with gambling and before I was a loser, I was pretty good at researching things. I mean, it was the whole reason I got paid, so I kind of had to be very good at it.\n\nBut anyways, looking up A and Mister Motherfucking Casino didn\u2019t seem to gleam any results. Their social medias had been deleted (I got Mr. P to look up their Instagrams and Facebooks) and their number wasn\u2019t reachable either (god bless Mr. P, again), so I figured I\u2019d look them up later and not waste time right now.\n\nMr. and Mrs. P, in the meanwhile, were calling up all their relatives and asking questions and explaining the situation, and apparently Granduncle Peter had recently died. I am so sorry for your loss, You\u2019re not reading this but like my condolences. There was no other news, though, and we were back at square one for people with motives for now. So that left us with figuring out what the deal with the box and the house was. \n\nThe only trace of the encounter I had left was the sticky note and the actual money in the envelope that I\u2019d taken in account for my troubles. I am pretty sure I saw a hand reach out and give it to me, but I don\u2019t remember who picked it up. The more I think about it, the more I think it could be a *what* and not a *who.* And that makes me consider ruling out the possibility that this thing was just a bad prank at all, and I think I\u2019m going to have a breakdown sometime this week. Dear Reddit users, comment about any therapists you know that can help someone not have nightmares lol I need to sleep desperately\n\nWe looked at every single bill and the sticky note for anything that seemed to be out of place and ended up overanalyzing everything. Right away, the handwriting was weird. I had been able to read it, but only barely\u2013partially because it was written so small, but also because it was written so weirdly. And no, I don\u2019t mean your average chicken-scratch or even Russian cursive\u2013I mean this was like someone right-handed tried to write with their left hand, but the pencil was held super weird and they routinely forgot how the letters were shaped. I hadn\u2019t noticed literally anything strange on the bills either\u2013I guess one of the benefits of having two overly critical people comb over everything too meant noticing things I didn\u2019t. There were weird marks on some of the bills. It was shapes, but like parts of shapes, and the outlines of them were so faint that we had to hold them to the light twice to make sure we weren\u2019t seeing things at one point. After sorting the bills into piles, we took a look at the envelope itself, and there were drops of what looked like dried blood on it. We were getting somewhere.\n\nI wasn\u2019t allowed to use any of the 40k :(, and I didn\u2019t exactly have too much money besides that, so I couldn\u2019t really buy anything. Mrs. P went to Walmart and brought one of those fun microscope things for kids because compound microscopes are like 400 apiece, and we weren\u2019t that desperate yet.\n\nIt didn\u2019t work (no surprise), and we decided we were that desperate, so we got the real thing. I dipped a swab in acetone (nail polish remover) and alcohol (rubbing alcohol was the most sterile thing I could find lmao) and rubbed it on the questionable stains on the envelope and then put it on a glass slide. There was barely anything to put on, though, but I managed to do the job somehow. Focused the lenses and all that\u2013it wasn\u2019t blood for sure. But also it didn\u2019t match the structure of literally anything I\u2019d seen ever, and nothing on the Internet gave similar results, so it definitely wasn\u2019t blood. \n\nWe all freaked the fuck out\u2013Mr. P was like *oh maybe it\u2019s tomato sauce.* Do yourself a favor and look up what tomato sauce looks like under a microscope. What we saw looked nothing like that. The worst part\u2013it seemed like it was moving oh-so-slowly under the microscope, and it looked *green* when it was focused on, but red when the lens was even slightly unfocused. I wanted to throw the whole thing away in a vat of acid, but that probably cost a lot.  For now, we swore to leave that thing and the microscope where it was, and to not go near that area at all. I was so glad I wore gloves, but I took an extra long bath. Mr. and Mrs. P went back to their hotel room for the night, I wrote this up, and I will now try my best to sleep.\n\nIt didn\u2019t really work, and I woke up at ass-o\u2019clock the next morning anyway because someone rang my fucking doorbell. Now, I didn\u2019t want a repeat of what had happened five days ago at that point, but I was also really sleepy, so I opened the door after a minute of debating whether I should open it or not. I SHOULDN\u2019T HAVE. \n\n(AT THIS POINT. I AM INCLUDING A DESCRIPTION FOR LIKE. BODY HORROR. LIKE BODY PART HORROR??? ANYWAYS DON\u2019T READ THIS IF IT\u2019LL GIVE YOU A HEART ATTACK OR SOMETHING OMG)\n\nMy dudes, seeing a severed hand *will traumatize you*, if you\u2019re not already traumatized. It seemed like it was pointing at something, but what was worse was the way it climbed OUT OF THE BOX???? I think I am going to delve into alcoholism at this rate to be honest. Anyway, it crawled out of this cardboard box (are you noticing a pattern with me and boxes) like a SPIDER, and I really don\u2019t want to write this I am so scared even thinking about it hours later, and the worst part is no one believes me and Mr. and Mrs. P and they probably secretly think I\u2019m crazy. It literally fucking *leapt for me and tried to choke me to death* and I was like half-asleep, so I pried it off with both hands and threw it somewhere and then it skittered around my sofa and it fucking VANISHED after picking up the envelope and the fucking slide, like it broke the microscope while I was trying to stab it and threw literally anything and everything at it, and then IT DISAPPEARED???\n\nI called the police and then I called Mr. and Mrs. P. The police showed up at like 4 in the morning and all they found was a bruise on my neck but they think I faked it or did it for my attention and the box was empty\u2013like not even a bit of blood, and my apartment was a mess and all my neighbors hate me because of the sirens in the middle of the night. \n\nI think I know what was in the box I delivered, and none of us like what it could mean. A severed hand came straight for whatever was on the envelope and the slide after it tried to kill me. What if I\u2019d delivered a severed body part to the house? What if there were more? We are in the middle of trying to figure out all of this, and lol if I\u2019m not dead I\u2019ll try to update those of you who wanted an update in like a week or something\n\nPLEASE SEND ME THERAPIST RECOMMENDATIONS I NEED ONE.

"movies,Aquartertoseven,The Wailing is a rare example of where a remake could improve upon the original,I just saw it last night.  The last 30 minutes were electrifying, it's just a shame that the 2 whole hours prior, barring the shaman ritual, didn't live up to it.  A few bits were laugh out loud when they presumably weren't supposed to be, while the dialogue and characterisation weren't what they should've been.  There were contrivances that I don't see an American production allowing, like how you could get all of these occult killings with contorted bodies, blackened faces in one area and NOT have the Japanese equivalent of the FBI get involved?  Even if they believed that spouses were killing their partners, the cult nature of identical circumstances continuously popping up would summon more than almost indifference from a local village cop.    \nHow the police could go to the Japanese man's hut, find his shrine with *photos and objects belonging to the dead* and NOT bring him in for questioning at the very least was absurd.  Whether he'd be charged is besides the point.  On the car ride home, it's noted that he had possession of a shoe belonging to the sergeant's daughter.  And yet they kept driving away!  You might say that the sergeant was afraid, yet he wasn't afraid enough to kill the man's dog, trash his home and threaten him, but he wouldn't arrest him for all of these things that were compromising?!    \nI will say that the ambiguity in the ending was brilliant; whether the woman in white was an angel or demon, whether the young Japanese shaman was a demon or good, both possibilities made sense when piecing the whole film together.  The ambiguity could conversely be problematic; if the woman in white was an angel, why not be clearer?  Playing almost a game as lives are on the line.  If the old Japanese man was a shaman, why not tell the cop and say 'I'm trying to protect people from the demon you're hunting'?  Why stand there quietly and let him kill the dog and trash the shrine as a demon is wreaking havoc?  Surely it would be in his interest to not be unnecessarily hindered?  Some think that the younger Japanese shaman was taking photos at the end to prevent their bodies from being possessed, which should've been mentioned beforehand; it would only add to his ambiguity, rather than seeming like a bad guy because all non-Korean viewers know is that photos are taken by the bad guys.  I also think that it possibly ended a little earlier than an American adaptation would; the priest was doomed and the sergeant's wife and mother were dead, but surely more bodies would increase attention?  Would the presumably angelic woman in white just let the demon slip away?  You could call it a simple 'bad guys win' scenario or truncated.  At the very least, a more conclusive remake wouldn't take away from the Korean original.  It's such a fascination film in retrospect, worthy of study.  The theory that the demon wasn't dead when the sergeant threw it off the cliff, that this act was the sin that culminated in the death of his family, is fascinating.  That the demon hopped from form to form, meaning that the old Japanese man was briefly free when being chased and showing fear, perhaps performing his rituals to stifle the demon when it was busy feeding in other forms, it's all fascinating.  It just needed more clarity and finesse.  A Western remake could make a masterpiece out of it.,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/v522ff/the_wailing_is_a_rare_example_of_where_a_remake/,False"

"nosleep,MistressTake,I Report Others For Breaking The Rules; Let My Story Be A Warning To Others Like Me,Before you read anything about my account, please know that I am sorry and will be changing my ways. I'm posting this as an apology and a warning. Once I hit SUBMIT and you are all able to read my words, I will be destroying my computer and leaving for good.\n\nI grew up a stickler for the rules. If something was made a rule, there must be a reason. This occasionally caused me issues in school but overall I was the teachers pet. Every teacher wants to their rules followed after all. If I heard about Johnny asking Tammie to let him copy her assignment I made sure to report them. If Susan was smoking on school property, I not only let the school know, but her parents and the police. \n\nOverall, I was a happy person. I met a wonderful partner who also shared my views on the \"correct\" way to do things and we were happy. At least, we were until I caught them going 1 mile over the speed limit on our way to the grocery store. I brought it to their attention, was thanked, and it didn't happen again. But soon other things started to pop up. I caught them telling a friend our Netflix password and telling their boss that they couldn't go to the mandatory teamwork retreat because we already had plans; we did NOT.\n\nAll of these instances were properly recorded and reported to those who needed to know, but together we were happy. Or so I believed until they moved out.\n\nIn my need to have control I became a monster. I didn't see it that way at the time, but I know now that I was the very definition. I spent my time on multiple websites and forums, reading and commenting. And reporting. Any and every possible infraction garnered a swift report. \n\nWas the post one word short of the post minimum word limit? Report.\n\nDid the poster have a NSFW profile on a site which stated it only allowed fully SFW profiles? Report.\n\nSomeone posted a question that had already been asked 3 years prior? Report.\n\nI was invincible because I had the rules on my side. Nothing could touch me. Or so I thought. After the last 24 hours though, I'm scared. \n\nI had just completed a follow-up message I would send to anyone caught breaking the rules, when there was an immediate response. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>DO YOU THINK YOU ARE ABOVE THE RULES?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe audacity. I follow every rule to the letter. Even when the rule is that someone can only send in  three post reports a day, I follow it. I'll admit, to do that one I had to limit myself to only READING three posts a day, each one always had something report-worthy inside, but that is irrelevant. I follow the rules. Brushing it aside, I closed out the message and moved on to my next target, reporting a post for cross-posting. Those especially angered me; think of original content, no one wants to see the same story or photo posted multiple times. How was anyone supposed to see your history if they go to your profile and only find the same post?\n\nExtremely satisfied with this report, I sent my follow-up message informing of the report. Immediately another response arrived.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>HOW DO YOU FOLLOW A RULE YOU DON'T KNOW EXISTS?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLooking to the username I confirmed these two accounts were not the same. They didn't post in the same places and appeared to have completely separate tastes. The words though gave me no pause; *how do you follow a rule you don't know exists*? That is not my issue, they should read the rules before posting.\n\nDeciding to move on, I changed to another area. This one was always lax with their rules in general so I was especially aggravated when a poster couldn't even follow the easy rules laid out. Seriously, how hard is it to \"respond to AutoMod with proof of claim\"? Very easy it would appear as the very first post on my screen was in violation. \"I was in the Subway when this happened\", is NOT proof; reported. This time though, I didn't even have a chance to pull up the poster's profile to send the message when a notice came in informing me I had a new message myself. Checking the name it was the same as the one just reported and read:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>RULE ONE: YOU MAY NOT SUBMIT MORE THAN 666 REPORTS IN ONE 189 HOUR WEEK  \n>  \n>PUNISHMENT: INCOMING\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPunishment incoming? What could that mean? And what rule are they making up? There is not a single rule written down anywhere that I have not followed to the letter. If someone was trying to scare me they would need to do a better job than this.\n\nStanding from my computer I put the words out of my head and walked into the kitchen to make dinner. As always, I pulled out a recipe card and made sure to be exact in my measurements. I loved how the seasonings made the flavors come alive in my mouth and as long as I was exact, the taste stayed the same. Setting one timer for 24 minutes and another for 25, I walked back to my computer to wait for them to ding.\n\nI had another message. A second line of: \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>PUNISHMENT: INCOMING\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI began writing a response back when two things happened at the same time. One, my first timer dinged; two, there was a banging on my door followed by the words \"Police! Open Up!\" being shouted through my door. What on earth? Hurrying to my door I opened it to find nothing and no one. Definitely no police. I was shutting my door when my second timer went off. Running into the kitchen, I pulled the food out of the over no more than 5 seconds after the timer stopped beeping. Surely this would cause no irreparable harm?\n\nPlating my food, it looked and smelled fine; delicious even. \n\nA new message was on my screen when I sat back at my desk.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>RULE TWENTY-FOUR: IF FOLLOWING ALL RULES, A FIVE MINUTE TIMER BUFFER, AND SIX INGREDIANT BUFFER MAY BE PROVIDED TO ALL MEALS CREATED. BREAKING A RULE REMOVES THIS BUFFER.  \n>  \n>PUNISHMENT: INCOMING\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhy was someone doing this to me? There is no such rule that I've ever seen. How would it even work? It makes no sense. So I took a bite of my delicious food. I tasted like the foulest thing imaginable. I choked and gagged at the flavor. The texture was also wrong; it felt as though something were moving inside my mouth. Running to the trash can I spit my mouthful out. Nothing, it appeared normal. Another bite was tried and this time, if possible, the taste was even worse. As I spit the bite out it felt as though mini razors were slicing into my skin. I spit out blood on top of the normal looking food.\n\nResigned to going to sleep hungry, I dumped the remaining food in the garbage, washed and put away my dishes and began my night time routine. While I was in the middle of flossing I swore I saw something out of the corner of my eye in the mirror. Startled, I turned around and looked everywhere. Whether inside my bathroom or throughout the rest of my house I saw nothing and no one suspicious. Giving up I climbed into bed and quickly fell asleep.\n\nMorning came with the sounding of my alarm in my ear. I attempted to turn over to silene the sound but found I was unable to do so. I made to sit up but couldn't do that either. I was immobile, stuck in place with nothing visible holding me down. My alarm continued to sound. Minutes turned to almost an hour when the feeling abruptly vanished. I could move again, I could turn off my alarm, I could get out of bed.\n\nI was going to be late.\n\nMy heart raced as I saw the time ticking by while I moved as fast as I could to complete my daily routine. The timing of the steps ran around my head again and again. Fifteen minutes for getting dressed, fifteen minutes for making and eating breakfast, three minutes to walk to my car, twenty-six minutes to drive to the office, eight minutes to reach my desk. I always arrived early and prepared buffer time for the unexpected. I was due at the office in exactly one hour. \n\nI was going to be late.\n\nI obeyed all social conventions and did not run to or from my car. I obeyed all traffic laws and did not speed, nor did I rush any lights or stop signs. I followed the rules. I was seven minutes late. This had never happened to me before and I didn't know what to expect. People would whisper. My boss would fire me. I was going to be homeless. Thoughts and feelings rushed through my mind as I tried and failed to process my work load that day. Each step in my direction felt like my doom. Seconds ticked by into minutes though, and those minutes eventually became hours.\n\nTime to leave. No one had said anything. Did I get away with it? Do I turn myself in? I was a whole seven minutes late. Nothing.\n\nBack home I tried my best to shake off the day and move forward. I needed control. I needed to put things back in order. Everything would be better if only.... If only.\n\nNo surprise, the moment I loaded my computer, multiple messages were flashing:\n\n>RULE SIXTY-THREE: ALWAYS COMPLETE YOUR ORAL HYGIENE ROUTINE IN FULL BEFORE CHECKING AREA FOR INTRUDERS  \n>  \n>PUNISHMENT: INCOMING\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n>RULE NINETEEN: IF RULES ARE FAILED THE PREVIOUS EVENING SET YOUR ALARM FOR THREE HOURS PRIOR TO YOUR NORMAL WAKE-UP TIME  \n>  \n>PUNISHMENT: INCOMING\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n>RULE FIVE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY-ONE: ARRIVE TO WORK ON TIME, EVEN IF PREVIOUS RULES HAVE BEEN BROKEN. IF MORE THAN THREE MINUTES HAVE PASSED BEYOND YOUR STATED WORK START TIME, AND ANOTHER RULE HAS ALSO BEEN BROKEN THE SAME DAY, SPILL A CUP OF COFFEE ON YOUR SHIRT BEFORE ENTERING THE BUILDING.  \n>  \n>PUNISHMENT: INCOMING\n\nWhat are these rules and who keeps sending them. It's only been 24 hours but I feel like my life is spiraling out of control. I tried to push it out of my mind but ANYTHING I did this entire evening would cause an immediate message to appear on my screen. A \"rule\" had been broken and punishment was \"incoming\".\n\nAt my wits-end I messaged one back asking for help:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>*Please! What do I need to do? I don't know where these rules are coming from. Help me! Please...*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI didn't know what to expect but I actually got a response back immediately:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>TELL YOUR STORY. DESTROY YOUR COMPUTER. LEAVE US ALONE.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI asked for clarification but only received the same response repeated over and over again. *\"Tell my story*?\"\n\nMy cell rang but when I picked it up the screen was still dark. Putting it back on the desk made my sound system turn on, the song \"How Do You Sleep At Night\" by John Lennon coming through my speakers. I pulled the plug, silencing the music only to have my overhead light begin to cut off and on. Something was going on and it terrified me.\n\n\"Fine,\" I shouted to air, feeling like a crazy person. \"I'll do it. I'll tell my tale and never touch another computer again. Okay?\"\n\nThe flickering immediately stopped. A blank word document appeared on my screen, the cursor flashing. I can do this, I thought, and began to write...\n\nI honestly don't know what to do from here. I have a cabin up north I've never been to and sensible savings set aside. I just want it to end so I can go back to my rule-abiding life. I'll say anything they want so they leave me alone. Hopefully, this works.,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/v524i5/i_report_others_for_breaking_the_rules_let_my/,False"

"TwoXChromosomes,Infamous-Alps-9595,Using just the Pill?,Hello,\n\n  I\u2019ve been on the pill for two years, but my fianc\u00e9 and I also used condoms until we got engaged earlier this year. We were originally planning to get married this August, but we\u2019ve now decided it make more sense to wait until next spring (date is now set for May of 23). So we figured the (accidental) pre-wedding pregnancy window would be short, but now it\u2019s going to be longer. \n\nIt wouldn\u2019t be the end of the world if I got pregnant before the wedding, except for the chance that my dress wouldn\u2019t fit. But this is the first time either of us has had condomless sex and we both LOVE it. We really don\u2019t want to have to go back to condoms, and it seems sort of silly to do so at this point anyway. What I guess I\u2019m asking is how much risk we\u2019re running. How many people here rely on just the pill? (P.S. I\u2019m REALLY careful about not missing pills and taking them exactly on time, but he does usually orgasm inside me.)\n\nThank you!,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/v50rf6/using_just_the_pill/,False"

As the gentleman had an extremely rare type of blood that couldn't be found locally, the call went out around the world.  \n\n\nFinally a Scotsman was located who had the same rare blood type.  After some coaxing, the Scot donated his blood for the Arab.  \nAfter the surgery the Arab sent the Scotsman a BMW, a diamond necklace for his wife, and $100,000 US dollars in appreciation for the blood donation.  \n\n\nA few months later, the Arab had to undergo a further corrective surgery procedure.  Once again, his doctor telephoned the Scotsman who was more than happy to donate his blood.  After the second surgery the Arab sent the Scotsman a thank-you card and a box of Quality Street chocolates.  \n\n\nThe Scotsman was shocked that the Arab did not reciprocate his kind gesture as he had anticipated.  He phoned the Arab and asked him: \"I thought you would be more generous than that. Last time you sent me a BMW, diamonds and money, but this time you only sent me a lousy thank-you card and a crappy box of chocolates?\"  \n\n\nTo this the Arab replied: \" Aye laddie, but I now have Scottish blood in ma veins.\",https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/v529s2/scottish_blood/,False"

Mick said he would, but he'll need to make up a story for Billy as Billy really loves horses.   \nOn the set day, Mickey and Billy head over to the farm. Billy asked what they're doing. Mickey said he just needs to collect some money from the farmer, for a gambling debt and told Billy to stay out by the barn.   \nA few minutes later, Mickey comes to the barn, acting angry, calling the farmer every name in the book and tells Billy he's going to shoot the farmer's horse as payback.

"nosleep,Lucky-Cat6027,Mr chuckles.,I\u2019m an investigative journalist and no I will not be giving out my name. For anyone curious as to why I\u2019m writing this the reason is rather simple, despite several warnings about personal safety from several peers of mine I have decided to launch a solo investigation into former (and long since canceled) children\u2019s television show Mr chuckles that ran from 1979 till 1980 and I\u2019m hoping to use this platform as a way to find more answers. Because the other ways in which I\u2019ve looked for information have no longer become of use.\n\nI guess a little bit more background information about this show might bring better context to my searchings and curiosity.  Mr chuckles centered around a kids party clown who each week tackled a variety of different subjects varying from divorce, knowing when to say no to drugs and alcohol and things of that nature. The network that ran the show was a local Canadian television station called sunshine studios that produced a variety of low quality kids programs that had regularly scheduled episode\u2019s of the different shows they were producing playing all across Canada every weekday and night.\n\n\nBut towards the end of the 60s intrest in the network and the shows on it started to dwindle.  So in a desperate attempt to capitalize on the popularity of shows like Mr rogers sunshine studios president jack O\u2019Leary sought out to create his own Mr rogers in an attempt to bring viewership numbers back up.\n\nSo In the summer of 1978 Mr chuckles began the beginning stages of development.  \n\nThat\u2019s where the creation (and reason for creation) stops.  The reason why I\u2019m writing this isn\u2019t to tell you the in depth history it\u2019s only to give each of you like I said, context.  Context that surrounds this case like a spider in its web. Now I can almost guarantee not a single person reading this has ever heard of this show and for good reason. Because everything about it has been wiped from internet and I do mean everything. Hell the only reason how I know about its existence is from a screenshot from one of the episodes taken from an old looking tv that was sent to me in an anonymous email a few weeks ago.  Before then I was as clueless as the rest of you.\n\nsomething in the screenshot caught my attention upon looking at it , in the background a child extra appeared to have been crying. And not fake acting tear\u2019s I mean this kid looked really shook up about something. What made it even weirder is that the scene he was in the background of was one of Mr chuckles and his friends smiling and laughing all in character. My guess is that kid wasn\u2019t meant to be seen but the camera man accidentally got him in the shot. \n\n\n after seeing this my mind started racing, I had to find answers as to who this kid was. So right then and there I decided to start digging. And let\u2019s just say the stuff I uncovered about this show , the studio ,and the people in front of the camera was a lot darker than I expected.\n\nMore details to come soon.

"nosleep,thechedarcheesman,There's an \"Owl\" Outside.,It was June 23rd, three years ago. I was visiting my mother, as she isn't much longer for the world and I haven't seen her in such a great deal of time. I had pulled into my mother's driveway, inside of my 2009 Toyota Camry, eager to see her once more. I got out and walked up to the door, knocking on the painted green, antique wood. My mother answered with an eager grin, and invited me in. The green recliner in the corner, the large sofa, and the old TV felt so familiar. I saw that she had made something too eat. I couldn't tell if it was ham or turkey, as it was in a different room, as well as being cut up. I told her I was thankful and she didn't have to do this for me, as I can cook myself, and wanted to make her something myself. She said not to mention it, as she was my mother. After the meal, she asked if I could stay the night. As she asked that, I thought I heard a tap on the window of the back door. I looked over and saw a blur, but brushed it off, as I had worked for over 7 hours today. A few hours passed of talking and watching TV and so we were ready to rest for the night, when I heard something. I looked out the window from the same back door, and I was greeted by an abnormally large, and strange looking great horned owl. My mother saw as well, and said she'd seen it all the time. It stared straight at me and something looked off. It looked like a mask instead of a face. Suddenly, it started getting closer, closer even closer. I locked the door quickly, dead locked, chained locked and all, as it crept closer it looked more and more like a man. Once it got to the door, my fear was proved correct. It was a 7'10 lanky man, with an owl mask that was melted into the skin on his face. He was so skinny, that his ribs, and spine was visible. It had looked as if he hadn't eaten in months. He had strange, talon-like hands and feet. he was wearing a black jumpsuit of some sort, also seemingly melted into his skin. He cocked his head, looking at us. I ran and grabbed the butcher knife. When I looked back, my mother was in pure disgust, so I had ran back to see, only to see his long, extended neck twisting in a grotesque spiral. I got my mother and ran into the bed room, locked her in the closet, and hid behind the opened door with the knife in hand. I looked through the crack, he was already there. I knew I locked the door. He entered the room, not noticing me. In my blind fear, I showed my coward's back, and I had ran. On my way out, I came to my senses, and realized I had left my mother, but it was too late, I heard it. the mincemeat, the screams, turned to wheezes, the struggling, I couldn't bare it. I had left the house after hearing it, on the way to my car, I hear the tapping of footsteps, fast footsteps. I had gotten to my car, and saw him right at the window. I drove away, feeling terrible over what I've sacrificed. I called the police as soon as I got home, and told them what happened. They checked, and found not even a single trace of human DNA besides my mother's. I've mostly got over it, but it still haunts me. And as I sleep tonight, I hear a tapping, a tapping at my bedroom window.,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/v52il4/theres_an_owl_outside/,False"

"personalfinance,johnychingaz,Ask for a raise/salary or switch to another company?,I (30M) have been employed with my current company for 6, going on 7 years. I went into the industry with zero knowledge and have worked my way up to where I\u2019m essential to the company\u2019s success and day to day operations. It\u2019s a family owned company that started out with 2/3 employees and is now at 8. In the time I have been there I have received no more than 4 \u201craises\u201d with only one being $1. (Others were .25/.50) I am the employee who has been at the warehouse the longest, yet one of the older guys who came 2yrs after me gets paid more than I am for way less work than I do. Even the new hire (1yr) secretary makes just a few dollars less a week than me! \n\nMy responsibilities include but are not limited to: taking care of walk-in customers, handling phone calls, making invoices, sending emails, quoting projects, cutting/fabrication, training the newer employees, scheduling deliveries, keeping inventory, unloading containers using forklift/dollies, warehouse maintenance etc. Basically managing the entire warehouse. I am full-time and work 5 days a week and sometimes half-day on Saturdays. (Which I don\u2019t even get compensated for properly)\n\nNow I can do that all day everyday, no problem. In fact the only problem is the pay. My boss recently purchased a property to move out of our current location. A few days ago a few of us went over to check it out and we had a few beers each. I\u2019m not sure how it came up but long story short, my boss was some how convinced that I had only been at the shop for 3-4 years! I was flabbergasted and quite frankly, pretty upset and feeling insulted and unappreciated after being there since 2015! It felt like a huge slap to the face considering the fact that I have turned down 3 offers from different companies with 1 standout offer that I always considered in the back of my mind. The offer is the same job position but more focused on being in the office with the first six responsibilities I listed earlier being the main focus. They\u2019re offering $2 more per hour, health benefits, paid vacations (which I only have 1 week now) & the drive is no more than 10mins more. \n\nIn conclusion I am asking for advice on the best way to approach my current boss about my pay and maybe insist he put me on salary. I have a feeling it won\u2019t be easy as his solution always seems to be to hire more people (that I have to train) & and that what I believe I rightly deserve will be too much to ask of him.\n\nOr should I just call up the company with the standout offer and see how much I can negotiate out of them?\n\nThank you for your time and thanks in advance for any advice you guys have.,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/v52jrc/ask_for_a_raisesalary_or_switch_to_another_company/,False"

I found myself deeply angry on Susie's behalf when she realized she had died; being robbed of growing up, going on her first date, discovering the world, graduating etc. Speaking from personal experience, I had a cousin that was like a sister to me who died when she was 8 and while I am an atheist, I deeply related to Lindsey and how as I experience the perils and joys of growing up, a part of my sister also gets to feel those moments. I liked how the story wasn't about revenge and I found this read quite cathartic.

"atheism,maybe_if_so,Gun control won't solve America's shooting problems, spreading faith in Jesus will,Marjorie Taylore Green recently said some stuff about how we don't need gun control, we need to go \"back to God\" as a society.\n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/www.businessinsider.com/marjorie-taylor-greene-pro-gun-tweet-texas-shooting-2022-5%3famp\n\nWhile I was growing up Baptist, I would hear this EXACT thing from church every weekend there was a school shooting.\n\n\"Taking away guns won't solve the problem. Our problem is a spiritual one. We are sinful. Sin is an illness, and mass shootings are a symptom of that illness. Gun control will only treat the symptoms of our illness. We need to treat the illness (of sinfulness) itself, and the cure, the medicine, for sin is Jesus. If 100% of people were Christian, shootings would never happen, because we would all see each other as made in the image of God, and murder would never happen. No one would want to commit sin!!\"\n\n*cheers and applaud from the audience*\n\n(By this logic, abortion, homosexuality, lying, adultery, divorce and premarital sex would also never happen)\n\nI'm making this post because I want to raise awareness that it is not just Greene's opinion that the solution is to \"go back to Jesus.\" This is a common Christian opinion, obviously not ALL Christians think this way, but this is what I was taught in church. Conservatives have been blaming irreligiosity for mass shootings since before Columbine. And they truly, honestly believe that if we get everyone to worship Jesus that school shootings (murder in general) will never happen again.\n\nPersonally, I think we'd be better off with gun laws like Japan.

"atheism,sneezery,Has anyone here been to rehab for Alcoholism? My brother, who is also atheist, has expressed that he wants help, but we are struggling to find non-faith based programs in his area (WV/OH),Skip to the *** if you don't have time for the whole story. Thanks!\n\nSome background. I can't say exactly how long he's been an alcoholic as we have a big age gap so it took me to being older to realize it. I remember it being at least 10 years. He has a 7 year old, and the week before she was born he got a DUI and hasn't had his license since and relies on her mom to take him places. He has always had a job and was a manager of a restaurant for 10 years until about a year or so ago when he made the decision to quit to search for better work, however he never got a job. He suffered from severe depression and always has so it's just a constant battle between the depression and alcoholism feeding each other. \n\nHe has finally said he wants help and wants to go to rehab. The actual following through with it completely overwhelms him. He expressed all this to me and I said I would find as much info as I can for him. While I know it ultimately will come down to him truly wanting it, but he's never even expressed interest in becoming clean or rehab. He recently had been going to therapy as well so it seems like he has definitely hit a pivotal moment.\n\n\n\n*** The issue is he is a hardcore atheist and most programs in his area are religion based. He also only has a medical card and no other insurance and no money. I know some places do take Medicaid, but I'm struggling to find places that aren't religious based. \n\nHe worries about being away from his daughter for too long and would like to be somewhat close to home so she could visit. He is in western West Virginia near the Ohio line so WV/OH/KY would be reasonable areas. Anyone know anything that isn't religious based? Or other recommendations on what to look for or avoid? \n\nThere is only so much I can do to help as I am half way across the country and have two kids. So any advice on what I can do from a distance? Things to say? Not to say? I really have no idea. \n\nThank you so much!,https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/v52tqw/has_anyone_here_been_to_rehab_for_alcoholism_my/,False"

Have them text you a code phrase-- if you sent the beacon by accident, you will let them know; if they don't get an all clear, they are to call the police and give them your current location. (If they call or text \"are you ok\" the aggressors could hear/see.)\n\nIt is totally wild/depressing that we need something like this, but it's a really good feature and I want everyone to be able to use it effectively if they should ever need (fingers crossed never.),https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/v52wn4/psa_your_smartwatch_has_an_emergency_beacon/,False"

"TwoXChromosomes,MamaBee2,Advice needed! Is my therapist correct?,\nHi, I am new to posting and have no idea where to post this, so if this is in the wrong place I\u2019m sorry. For backstory, when I was 16 I was a bit of a wild child. My best friend was a guy (I\u2019m a girl) who was a year older than me. He hung out with mostly older guys who were in college already and that summer we all started hanging out. I was typically the only girl in the group unless they brought whatever girl they were talking to or I brought girl friends of my own.\nOne night my best friend, his guy friends and I were supposed to go to a party. On the way there it got shut down by cops, but they still wanted to have fun so we all went back to one of the guy\u2019s houses to drink (his parents were on a trip so he had the house to himself). Three of the guys were old enough to buy alcohol so they bought some and we all went back to his house. I know I\u2019m an absolute idiot for drinking with a group of guys as the only girl, but I had known them for a bit and I trusted my best friend. We all play drinking games and I am fairly buzzed at this point. They just keep giving me shot after shot. It gets really hazy, but at one point one of them dared me to kiss one of the guys that I had been kinda having a thing with (just flirting - nothing else at all). He was 21. I didn\u2019t know what to do so I did it and they all kept giving me more alcohol. At one point, my best friend left. So it was just me and the group of older guys. I remember feeling really sick, hot and dizzy. I asked if there was somewhere I could lay down because I did not feel well. I go and lay down in the guest room. The next thing I remember the guy I kissed is at my head taking my shirt off and 2 of the other guys are taking off my pants. I remember trying to say something, but it\u2019s like I couldn\u2019t get my voice to work. It gets hazy and the next thing I remember is him having sex with me and me trying to move my arms, but they felt like lead. I couldn\u2019t get any part of me to move. I remember starring at the wall and it felt like it wasn\u2019t even my body anymore. It\u2019s hard to explain. I must have made a noise bc he told me he was almost done. The last thing I remember was the two who took off my pants coming in and and another at the doorway. The two came to sit on the bed next to me and one starting rubbing my leg. Then it\u2019s just black and I don\u2019t remember anything. I woke up in the morning on the bed, sore all over and felt like I had been hit by a truck. I don\u2019t even know where anyone was, I just found my keys and phone and I left. When I saw them downtown at a 4th of July event later that week they acted like nothing happened. So I guess I did the same.\nI was embarrassed and absolutely disgusted with myself. I couldn\u2019t even look in the mirror for awhile after it. I blew it off and tried to act cool around them and my best friend for a long time. I just wanted it to go away. I\u2019m now in my 20\u2019s and I hadn\u2019t thought about it until a few months ago when I started having panic attacks during sex with my husband. I\u2019m currently in therapy due to some things that happened to me when I was younger and when I mentioned flashbacks of this she very bluntly said that was rape. Rape feels like a sharp word to use for something I brought on myself. I didn\u2019t want it, but I didn\u2019t fight anyone off. I didn\u2019t tell anyone no. I just laid there and couldn\u2019t make myself move or speak. I feel like there has to be some form of me saying no or trying to get away for it to be rape. I\u2019m having a really really hard time seeing this like that and I can\u2019t ask anyone in my life about it. I would be devastated if someone in my life heard or knew about it. Is my therapist right? Or am I right in thinking she\u2019s calling this a crime when it\u2019s really just my fault.\nSorry for the book. Thank you for any thoughts.,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/v52f1a/advice_needed_is_my_therapist_correct/,False"

"tifu,WiseScrum,TIFU by taking up to 2200mg of cannibis edibles.,Last week, I really had a bad time and an awful day. I was walking down the street and went to my local shop to buy cannibis. I was surprised that they were selling edibles and I managed to get some and mix up to 1000mg at first. I got some more and mixed up to a total of 2200mg of THC edibles. It was interesting and I just wasn't in my right mind at this point. I got the mixture of the edibles and went to the biggest park in my city. I meditated for an hour and then went to a quiet place.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n I took all 2200mg of cannibis in one sitting. I chewed it and swallowed it completely. Yes, it sounds completely insane but I will explain what happened hours before. I had a rough time with my family and got locked out of the house because of toxic bullshit with my mom and relatives. I had a meltdown and wanted to cool down. As I walked down the street, I found a weed shop and was able to legally buy some marijuana. Anyway, I am in the park and I feel no effect after a couple of minutes. I get frustrated because this hasn't started working yet. I get up and start walking but suddenly, I feel dizzy and in a trance-like stance. I started hearing buzzing noise or something close to an airplane noise near my ears. I suddenly went back to my seat like I was under a trance again. I sat down, wide eyed and just kept walking back and forth. My senses went way too high and it felt like I was about to explode. It's like I was in my body but something else took control.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n I tried to get up several times but it was still difficult to move as I stayed in place. A few folks came over to check up on me but I said that I was fine. I kept shaking more and more as I went on and it was hard for me to continue. I found myself losing my mind as I regret taking this drug. It was a struggle for me to walk home and to go on the train station. I kept thinking that I was going to be like this forever and it scares me that one little mistake like this can change my whole life forever. I started seeing weird shapes and beings that kept taunting me and insulted me for taking this huge amount of THC edibles. I kept thinking about even jumping in the street to get hit by a car but I forced myself to stay put and to not get killed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n I didn't want to put anyone through any pain with my foolish mistake that I made. As I entered the train station, I was struggling to stay under control because I kept talking way too fast. I started praying to Jesus Christ for a long time and I was reciting passages and prayers from the Bible to fix my mind because I didn't want to lose my mind and be locked in a mental hospital. As I prayed to God more and more, I did feel okay. People were looking at me and laughing. Some even pulled out their cameras and started recording but I couldn't do anything as I was losing control of myself. I was even talking to myself, not realizing what the hell I was doing. Losing my mind was so scary that even in the train, it was still embarrassing. Someone took out their phone to record me and started laughing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n As I went home, I felt so dizzy and knocked on the door. My house is divided by tenants so one of them opened the door and I rushed in. They asked if I am okay and I said yes. I felt sick. I ran up the stairs and my sisters asked if I was okay and I was talking so fast. I ran in and shut the door immediately. I felt like it was a huge swelling in my body as I still struggled to stay calm. I literally felt like I was going to explode completely and I tried to strap myself to my bed and locked my door. I tried to go to sleep and it was hard as hell. Losing my mind is the worst thing to happen to someone and I don't wish it on my worst enemy. Hours later, I thought the effect slowed down but when I got up again, I still felt a loss of control of my body and mind. I eventually managed to sleep but in the next morning, it was hard to stay sane because the effects was still on me and it didn't wear off. I really thought that I was over with. Days later, the effects have been gone by now. Don't try this stuff, guys.\n\nTLDR; I realized that I just took up to over 2000mg of marijuana and that really messed me up hard.

"personalfinance,_throwawaysumday,Questionable deposit amount in advanced of a home loan, I have some interconnected problems and need some help from you wise folks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy   mother is old (77yr) and has been relying on government assistance to get by. But to qualify for those benefits, she can't make/have too much money. She's been doing odd jobs like gardening and cleaning homes for people in the neighborhood since we moved to the United States. She's only ever worked like maybe \\~10hrs a week for the last \\~15years. Little did I know she's just been holding onto all this cash and spending, virtually nothing.  I can't spell out certain terms because of the sub rules, but at \\~12/hr, you can do the math. Literally in paper cash; never thought I'd see that in-person in my life. A lot smaller in physical size than you might   think...anyways...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am looking at purchasing a new home (needing financing). My mother wants for my sister for move out (from my mother's) and to move in with me (okay). My mother wants to give me most of her cash. Some of it, she wants me to hold onto it, some of it she wants me to put towards a down payment. Whoa, right? Well the reason is my brother is also still  living  with my mom and he's a piece of shit (into drugs being the most recent reason), but my mom still loves him and will continue to take  care of  him. However, there was a recent encounter my brother had with  the  police at her home. She was mortified that they'd find her money.  And in  the back of her mind, she has been scared that my brother would  find it  too and steal it. He's stolen before, but in the single digit  thousands  at most. So she wants that money out of the house; and my  sister for  that matter.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI  definitely don't want cash lying around, and I can't really do that if  I need some of it for my down payment. So I need to deposit it to a  bank.  From Googling, I've definitely learned that I can't \"structure\"   deposits, that's illegal, and I'm better off depositing as a lump sum (okay). So, lets say I deposit it into my bank, and I even prepare a   letter from my mom with all the contents for it being a \"gift\". What is   the likelihood that the bank or government will investigate my mother?   Will she get in trouble for having as much cash as she has? Are there   other issues I might be missing?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAny advice on how I should go about this would be very helpful.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR;   I need to deposit a 6-figure amount of physical cash that was procured 99.9% legally. I'm   nervous that the 0.1% that isn't completely kosher, will get my mother in trouble.,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/v52zzw/questionable_deposit_amount_in_advanced_of_a_home/,False"

"personalfinance,Only_Positive_Vibes,Is it reasonable to ask my landlord why they're increasing my rent 15%?,I understand what's going on with the housing market right now. Inflation is through the roof, interest rates are on the rise, and it's a seller's market. My wife and I rent an apartment in a somewhat large apartment complex and our landlord is increasing our rent 15%. In their defense, they're also renting out places to new tenants at a price that would be a \\~30% increase over our current rent, so it does sort of seem like they're trying to be \"fair\" to current tenants. I'm just having a tough time reconciling an increase that's 2x inflation with no actual improvements or changes to the overall quality of life since we've been here the last two years. Everywhere else in the immediate area (NE US) is renting at a comparable rate.\n\nIs it fair to ask them what's causing such a significant increase, or should I stop whining and renew the lease or find somewhere else to live?,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/v5322x/is_it_reasonable_to_ask_my_landlord_why_theyre/,False"

"personalfinance,noelcharbs,Was rear ended and need helping deciding to buy or lease or repair?,Last week I got rear ended by an old lady that didn't brake at all and rammed me going 50mph. Old lady admitted to cops she wasn't paying attention and of course was NOT ticketed, but I'll leave that rant to another subreddit.\n\nMy car was a paid off '15 Malibu that I took great care of. Car was in great condition that just needed rear brakes. I had every intention of driving that sucker in the ground and it absolutely pains me having thought of going back to a car payment. \n\nInfo about me: Made $200,000 in 2021. $57,000 in student loan debt with monthly payment of $2,000/mo. $0 CC debt. Maxed out 403(b), IRA, and HSA contributions. Have a baby on the way with I am not lying her due date is tomorrow. Currently saving for a down payment on a house and I despise the idea of dipping into that fund for an auto loan or dipping into my retirement/IRA or emergency fund. I could dip into the emerg fund, but with baby on the way I'd rather confirm mom and baby are good before I go spending it on a vehicle. Currently using partner's car.\n\nOption 1: Got an estimate of $5,400 from local auto body shop. I did not have collision insurance, but according to Michigan law I am eligible for $3,000 mini tort. Just waiting for old lady's insurance to cut me a check. Car is drivable, just has extensive rear damage. But $5,400 is pretty penny to drop on a car that is 7yrs old and has a 135,000 miles on it. \n\nOption 2: Use $3,000 mini tort and the $500 from junkyard for car towards down payment and get a new 2022 bigger vehicle for 24 mo/12,000 miles $4,500 due at signing and $439/mo. I like the idea of just having vehicle short term in case I hate it and get out sooner. However, I've done a lease before and I HATED having to garage the car because I drove it too much. I'm visiting parents that live 100 miles away or just driving around the state enjoying the beauty of it. I could potentially look into the 15,000 miles option.\n\nOption 3: Use $3,500 down payment (probably more) and buy brand new 2022 that is $30,000 and is about a $650/mo monthly payment with interest being anywhere from 2.5 to 2.9% from what I have seen thru my credit union and dealer financing.\n\nOption 4: Use $3,500 and buy a used car in what I'm assuming is still an inflated market?\n\nWhat would you do if you were in my situation?\n\nMy head is saying option #1 because I know the car and history of it.,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/v533ro/was_rear_ended_and_need_helping_deciding_to_buy/,False"

Yes. Implication of wanting to commit incest? Yup. Implication of forcing children to have sex with dogs? Yuppers. Gore? Oh yeah. Attempted rape? You got it. Gender dysphoria? It has that too. Children burning alive? Yessiree. Explicit nudity? Oddly enough, no\n\nDespite that though, Fire Punch is still entertaining and can be really deep and thought-provoking\n\nFf you wanna read it, the plot is that there's a super cold blizzard that froze the world, so the world is now a frozen wasteland. Some of the survivors have superhero-like powers. Two siblings have Deadpool-like regeneration. One day, a military general (and his convoy) burn the two alive using his fire power. However, this fire only gets extinguished when the person being burned dies. So the younger sibling dies since her healing factor isn't that strong, while the older one doesn't die because his healing heals him faster than the fire can burn him. However, the older sibling basically like the Human Torch now, except the fire hurts super bad and spent 8 years on the ground in pain until his body got used to the pain and enabled him to walk again.

That personal loan was the result of a previous attempt to consolidate debt - I failed.\n\nI recently decided to take out another personal loan for 13k at 5.99% to pay off previous loan and most of the credit card debt.

"atheism,Ye_time299,The Catholic Church is the most negative thing to happen to humanity,(rant)I honestly don\u2019t have a problem with religious people. Theres normal religious people just like theres normal atheists or hindus. But honestly it really befuddles me that people can so vehemently protect an organization that CLEARLY is just made for power. The catholic church is the greatest hypocrisy in human history, how much innocent blood was shed so humans could \u201cshow others the right way\u201d. It\u2019s pretty clear that religion was invented to give guidance and help others with troubles in their life. A noble cause, no doubt. But it\u2019s also really clear that along the way it was twisted by power hungry POS humans who wanted control and said \u201cOnly I can tell you if God likes you or not\u201d and used Hell as a fear tactic. The devil wasn\u2019t even in the old testament and god seemed to be as vengeful as the devil himself. It also pisses me off when people send their thoughts and prayers. Clearly your prayers are not being answered and you\u2019re being used. The bible clearly states all humans are equal in the eyes of god. Oh, so why did the hundreds of popes claim that they were closer to god the rest of us? Why do preachers get to tell us if were going to heaven or hell? Why do billions suffer despite an all powerful god being able to stop it at anytime? \u201cOh it\u2019s the devil or human nature\u201d. But I thought God was all powerful? Why wouldn\u2019t he put a stop to all of this? Why wouldn\u2019t he have designed human nature to be better? The first story in the bible is literally god baiting somebody into doing something bad so he could punish them. It\u2019s insane. You would think that if over a billion people follow religion then maybe one of them would have hard evidence of God\u2019s existence.\n(Rant over),https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/v52zo1/the_catholic_church_is_the_most_negative_thing_to/,False"

"personalfinance,jcr312,Risk of withdrawing funds during mortgage application?,I'm (hopefully) at the end of a long home search and could use some guidance about potential risks that would get in the way of me obtaining financing.\n\nI'm applying for a conventional mortgage on a $600k property (a third home), putting 20% down. I  currently have $275k in cash, $500k+ in stock I could easily sell if needed. \n\nI'm provisionally approved for the mortgage with a close date of June 30th. One problem - I need to make a withdrawal of \\~$50k in cash from my account right away. (Long story, but a family member left  this $ to my brother and I back in 2018, and he now needs his share to close on a house himself.)\n\nI've read a lot about the potential risks of depositing funds to a bank account during the mortgage approval process, but should I worry about transferring funds out? After the withdrawal I will still have plenty of cash on hand to close on the property, and a significant amount of stock I could liquidate - wondering if the bank will notice and if they'll care. (I know in the past a bank has pulled my credit a second time right before the closing.)\n\nThanks in advance!,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/v5397z/risk_of_withdrawing_funds_during_mortgage/,False"

I usually just get a few things and self check out but today I had to use the cashier because I got some premade salad bowls that were on special and you have to go to them to get this discount.\n\nUsually it's very busy but when I went its was kinda slow. I got my stuff and went to the check out line and there was this nice older lady with like 5 kids from 3 -13 loading up her groceries in front, I wasn't paying attention at first but after a few minutes looked up and see her talking with the cashier and the oldest daughter translating for her mom. They were short for their tab and they started sorting out stuff to put back.\n\nI used to watch this show on ABC called \"What would you do\" where situations would play out as a hidden camera show and this situation has been shown a few times. Me not thinking just told the cashier I'd pay the remaining balance and that it was no big deal. Might get on TV, at the worst might be down 20 bucks.\n\nThe lady started crying and the other older daughter did too, they started thanking me and saying thank god in spanish, I speak spanish too so told her it was no big deal.\n\nI didn't realize how much they were short, they had a bunch of stuff already bagged so it turns out they were like 70 short. I just paid bills so I'm kinda broke myself and thought it might be only like 20 but I didn't want to make them put stuff back so I bit the bullet and paid. I'll probably have to take the bus to work for the next week but at least they're taken care of.\n\nTL;DR: Paid for some groceries for a small family cause I thought I might be on a TV show and it was a lot more than I expected.,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/v53c0g/tifu_by_thinking_i_might_on_a_tv_show/,False"

"nosleep,Beto5566,I\u2019ve Never actually seen my dog eat before. Now I know why., \n\nI adopted Daisy a little over four years ago while I was in the worst depression of my life. Immediately after bringing her home it felt like that warm little ball of fuzz and puppy teeth was working to fill that gaping hole left in my life after the death of my brother. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**I can say with confidence that she\u2019s saved my life twice now.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe\u2019s a healthy 134 pound Saint Bernard with no concept of personal space and I love her to death. She knows a handful of tricks, but she\u2019s stubborn and rarely cooperates. In many ways she\u2019s a completely mundane dog, content to act as my personal weighted blanket at any and all opportunities. The only thing out of the ordinary about Daisy is that I have never in my life seen her eat anything.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat is, until recently.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEspecially as a puppy, this behavior was extremely concerning to me. I tried hand feeding her, mixing her food with warm water, hell I even tried bottle feeding her. She wouldn\u2019t eat any of it. Four days after I first adopted her I was about to call the vet to schedule an appointment when I noticed something.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe bowl I left out for her was empty. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe small aluminum dish that was packed with a pale brown mountain of dried dog food the night before had entirely vanished, save for a few loose crumbs left at the bottom. Relieved, I refilled the bowl, thinking that maybe Daisy was just shy, or adjusting to her new home or something like that. Still, I consulted with the vet about this behavior at her next check-up. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u201cWell she\u2019s definitely a healthy weight for her age,\u201d The Vet said nonchalantly as she hoisted Daisy off the scale. \u201cIt's not unheard of for dogs to do this sort of thing, especially as puppies,\u201d she continued. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u201cJust be sure to keep an eye out for any weight loss, lethargy, or vomiting,\u201d she warned. \u201cIf you do, give me a call immediately,\u201d she said, crouching down to pet Daisy on the head, which she returned with an inelegant kiss on the cheek.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo thinking nothing of it, we left. Months turned to years and Daisy remained the picture of canine health, save for a brief case of kennel cough a few weeks after her second birthday. Each night, I would fill her bowl, and each morning it would be picked clean, yet I would never actually see her eating. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI found myself on occasion checking the bowl late into the night. Over the years I\u2019ve narrowed it down to around 1:45 AM being the time the bowl goes from full to empty. Even still, she\u2019s never eaten anything around me. Not treats, not kibble, even when I offer her some steak or chicken she turns her head to the side or smacks it out of my hand before walking away as if I\u2019ve offended her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat all changed last week.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt started off as standard as any other Saturday night. I was on the couch binge watching whatever a series I can\u2019t recall, Daisy, sleeping soundly on top of me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWith a start, she leaped off my chest and onto the floor, darting out of the room. Immediately I got up, Daisy never acts like this. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFumbling through the dark of the house, feeling out for a light switch, I heard it. A low growl, coming from the far side of the room. That was when I heard a sharp yelp, and the weighty thump of fur hitting the hardwood floor.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**I didn\u2019t even think.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI charged into the darkness after Daisy, just as my eyes adjusted to the dim light of the kitchen I was able to make out the silhouette of a man. He was tall, his obscured head nearly brushed the ceiling. The rest of his figure was indescribable in the dark, standing as an obelisk of pure obsidian, cutting through the dull gray. He was standing in front of an open window that I was *sure* I had locked. He reeled back to kick Daisy once more when I threw myself at him, tackling him blindly to the floor.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI felt nothing but pure animosity for this man as I began to wail mercilessly on him, pummeling his face, chest, anything within reach. I grabbed his head as I pinned him to the floor and began slamming it into the hardwood. I pulled back my arm, fully intending to shatter this stranger\u2019s nose into his brain for even touching Daisy, when I felt a hot sting in my side. I looked down.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**He stabbed me.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA small knife was jammed into my abdomen, the blade shining in the dim light, blood trickling down the cool silver and pooling at my feet. The intruder pushed me to the side, the blade digging even deeper into my torso, with pain spreading throughout like a white hot nail being driven along my veins. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe stood up, dusting himself off before delivering a strong kick to the back of my head for good measure, the blow sending me reeling as I struggled for breath.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat\u2019s when I heard something snap.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt sounded exactly like when you break a twig in half, the fibrous material straining against itself as it tears asunder. Alarmingly, the sound was coming from Daisy\u2019s direction, who had yet to move from the corner she had been kicked into. As she stood upright I heard it again, as well as a meaty thump that sounded almost like wet laundry falling on concrete.\n\n \n\nWhat rose from Daisy\u2019s spot on the floor could scarcely be called a dog. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don\u2019t know if it was the kick to the head, the blood loss, or a combination of the two, but what I saw that day was not of this world. Massive, even larger than Daisy, and with mandibles dripping with shred flesh that bisected her face. Her coat slumped off, revealing reptilian scales that glistened with moisture. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBefore I could even blink, a mass of writhing tentacles burst forward from between the mandibles, grabbing the intruder by the ankles and torso, causing him to slam into the ground before being pulled toward Daisy's maw. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**I\u2019m sure you can imagine what happened next.** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBetween the gurgling screams and the blood and viscera being thrown across the room, I\u2019m glad I lost consciousness around this point.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen I woke up several hours later, I was in the hospital with Daisy sleeping comfortably at my side, barely fitting into the cramped bed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nApparently, a neighbor heard the commotion and called the police to investigate. When they got inside they found me lying in a pool of my own blood, Daisy by my side, thankfully unharmed. They found no trace of a break-in, so they bought my made up story about tripping and falling onto a knife with concerning ease.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI\u2019m writing this weeks later, my side still hurts and Daisy is just as lovely as ever. She\u2019s laying on my legs as I write this now in fact. I still think back to that night, but strangely I\u2019m not as wary of her as one might think. She\u2019s still my dog and I love her, even if she does turn out to be some crazy tentacle monster.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWell either way, I think I know what she eats now. Only one question still haunts my mind.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Who or what has she been eating up until then?**,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/v53diq/ive_never_actually_seen_my_dog_eat_before_now_i/,False"

"Music,luxurycomedyoohyeah,Beginning Music at age 43 - Update,Here is my first OP, about starting to learn music at age 43:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/uwuzma/beginning\\_music\\_at\\_age\\_43/ia09dlu/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/uwuzma/beginning_music_at_age_43/ia09dlu/?context=3)\n\nWhat a journey it's been so far! So I ended up buying a guitar! She's a second-hand student acoustic guitar, but she's in good shape and is just what I need to get started. My friend's son just upgraded to an electric guitar so they sold me the old acoustic. \n\nI've had the guitar for 9 days now - and WOW! I've practiced every day. I know 5 chords now (a friend said that's two more than I need to know! haha) and I'm practicing finger-picking, strumming techniques and a spider exercises to stretch my fingers. I have calluses forming on my fretting hand already! I'm also just starting to learn to read sheet music.\n\nI went to my friend's studio the other day and I got to try out keyboard, synth, drums, and a big ol' heavy electric bass guitar! The bass was awesome and it was so easy to play my guitar after slapping that thing for a bit!\n\nI also just started working on my first song! The Maze by Manchester Orchestra. I chose it because it's a slow song and generally easy chord transitions, except for that Gbm chord - man that is hard. So there's a bit of a challenge there for me too.\n\nI'm absolutely fascinated by it, although I don't think I've ever attempted to learn anything so hard. It is such an intricate instrument. What I find really interesting is how my mind is expanding so much each time I practice. One day I will find something difficult and a bit frustrating, and then the next day I'll pick up the guitar and it will just come to me. I can't wait to see where I am in a month, in a year, etc. I can literally feel my brain forming new neural pathways when I practice!\n\nSo far the most challenging part is the strumming patterns. I have cultivated next to no rhythm in my life so keeping time to a pattern seems near impossible right now, but I will soldier on.\n\nJust keen to keep building that muscle memory. I can only practice for about 20-30 minutes right now before my fingers start to hurt, but that's all I really have time for every day anyway, so it's perfect. It's really easy for me to pick up the guitar and practice in between doing other things.\n\nI feel like this is all more than enough to keep me busy for the next little while.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/v53ii2/beginning_music_at_age_43_update/,False"

"nosleep,xR3D_D3ATHx,I Was Chased by Something While Walking Home One Night,  \n\nWhat I\u2019m about to tell you is something I know that you\u2019re not going to believe, but quite frankly I don\u2019t care. I just need there to be some record of this story out there for my own sake. It all started a few weeks ago, my girlfriend had left me a few days earlier and I decided I needed to try and cheer myself up. So, me and a couple of friends went and got a little high while watching some dumb comedy movies at one of their places. After around 11 o\u2019clock at night I decided it was probably time to pack up and go, but since we were all a bit high none of us wanted to risk driving back home and since I was the one who happened to live the furthest away, I would have to walk nearly over an hour to my house in the next town over. Now, I know what you\u2019re probably thinking, why not just call someone to pick you up? Well, the reason for that was because everyone I was already close with in my very small friend group was either also high or was my pissed off ex.\n\nI honestly didn\u2019t mind having to walk at first, and to try and help save some time I decided to cut through this sort of woodsy prairie area that\u2019s in between the two towns. While walking through there, that\u2019s when I noticed it, it was nothing, and I mean absolutely nothing. There were no insects chattering, no owls screeching, and no sounds of anything but me moving through the underbrush. The entire area was just dead quiet, and it unnerved me. I stood still there for the longest time observing my surroundings. I thought that it only got this quiet when predators were nearby. I looked in the tree line to my right and saw a sight that still frightens me today. It was the silhouette of some large hulking beast with two glowing red eyes staring right at me. I thought about what to do and stupidly decided that maybe if I stood still it would go away and leave me alone. \n\nAfter around five minutes of just standing perfectly still I began to panic and made a B-line for the other side of the prairie. While running I looked back and saw that the thing was chasing after me while staying in the tree line. As I ran out of the prairie I came to a local golf course, as I was running I saw a small storage shed and went towards it for shelter.\n\nI hid in that shed for around maybe fifteen to twenty minutes. I didn\u2019t see the thing through the tiny shed window but I could hear it as it was stalking and rustling through the grass looking for me. Suddenly, it burst it\u2019s head right through the window and bit my arm. At that moment I saw that the creature was very dog-like with a furry face and sharp canines. I punched the thing right between the eyes and it let go of my arm. As it was distracted by the pain, I bolted out of the shed and made a run for the closest street. I eventually ended up on Main Street and I knew that my home was only a few blocks down from where I was. I looked back to see if the thing was following me but all I saw was the empty golf course. Not wanting to take risks, I ran as fast as I could down the street clutching the broken skin on my arm until I eventually made it to my street and onto my front lawn. Once there I saw it again, looming right across the street and slowly approaching me. Not making any sudden movements I made my way to the front door of my house. Seeing the silver knocker on it and hoping that I had accidentally left it unlocked again. When I was about \u00be of the way there and the thing was on my front lawn now I dashed and opened the door, quickly closing and locking it behind me. The thing tried pounding at the door but then gave out a sharp cry and gave up. I looked through the peephole and saw nothing. I assumed it must have gotten bored and just ran off. I made my way to the kitchen and cleaned the bite on my arm as best I could and bandaged it up. I thought about calling the cops or animal control but I knew that they would never believe me. Eventually I just passed out on a couch from exhaustion and that was it.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t be telling this story if that was the end though, it\u2019s been over a month now and just three days ago my ex died, they found her body torn to shreds and gnawed on in the middle of the woods. The cops are saying that she drunkenly wandered off from some bonfire party and must have had a grim run in with a bear. But I know better, it wasn\u2019t a bear and I don\u2019t think it was whatever that thing was, I think I killed her. I have no memory of that night and the next morning I woke up and found myself caked in blood. \n\nI find myself now sitting here typing this out. I've completely cut myself off from everyone in fear of hurting others. If anyone out there knows what's happening to me please help.,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/v53lgt/i_was_chased_by_something_while_walking_home_one/,False"

Hes experiences with sex and kissing while me on the other hand I have no experience what so ever! He\u2019s totally fine with waiting for marriage. \n\nwhen we kiss an makeout i feel nothing unless I arouse myself by pressing my body against his and really focusing an tensing myself that\u2019s when i start to feel something but it literally feels like my vagina is playing the drums or something like that! Is that normal! I don\u2019t get wet or anything but when I get aroused it feels like something is knocking in my vagina. \n\nMy boyfriend tells me he really loves me a lot because even though we don\u2019t have sex when he masturbates while thinking of me soo much semen comes out!

"movies,LoudyKing101,Judge my unpopular animated movie opinions.,Cars 2 is actually a pretty fun movie: It's not the greatest movie in the world, but it is a pretty fun animated spy spoof. Mater can be annoying, but he isn't downright unbearable. If anything, you really need to turn off your brain for this one.\n\nSmurfs: The Lost Village is a genuinely amazing movie, and could very well become a cult classic someday: The first two Smurfs movies are god awful, no doubt about it. Sony obviously realized this, and decided to reboot the continuity with a fully animated third movie. While it only got slightly better ratings than the live-action films (it currently sits at a 40 on Rotten Tomatoes) and was a box office bomb, I feel that it may have been due to Smurf burnout. This movie is probably the most faithful adaptation of The Smurfs that we have gotten. Director Kelly Asbury (of Shrek 2 and Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron fame, may he rest in peace) wanted to make a Smurf film that creator Peyo would be proud of, had he been still alive. And he mostly succeeded. Despite some clunky moments here and there, the movie has a beautiful visual style that kind of acts as a precursor to what Sony Animation would do with Into the Spider-Verse later on. The story may be a bit simple, but it is very effective. It is interesting seeing Smurfette trying to figure out what she wants to be, and the hidden village of female Smurfs is quite the cool concept. The voice cast is pretty solid too, but Rainn Wilson steals the show as Gargamel. This movie should be a cult classic, and should be talked about more.\n\nIllumination can make great movies, and it's not for lack of trying: The first 2 Despicable Me movies were fun. The Grinch was pretty enjoyable, too, and they actually tried with that one. The artstyle is very whimsical and Seussian, and it is nowhere near is insulting as The Lorax was. The problem with Illumination lies with their parent company, Universal Pictures. They want Illumination's movies to appeal to the masses and be over-commercialized, and that works well in the finance and business sense of things. On the critical side of things, though, it leads to a safe and ultimately mediocre product. They want it to be trendy and hip, but that lessens the movie's quality. If anything, Universal should give Illumination some autonomy, and the freedom to do their own thing. It will allow them to make high-quality animated films, not to mention acclaim. I really hope that the Mario movie will be Illumination's big comeback (their Spider-Verse, so to speak), especially with the oversight of Mario creator Miyamoto himself, but we will just have to see.,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/v53qug/judge_my_unpopular_animated_movie_opinions/,False"

"books,happy_bluebird,The Good Sister, by Sally Hepworth,I finished reading it today and eagerly searched this sub for discussion, but was surprised not to find much.\n\nThis was one of those books where even before you finish it you KNOW you're giving it a 5/5. I loved the characters, the story, the dark twisty-ness, the way you start to suspect something's fishy and then it goes SO MUCH DEEPER... I'll try not to say too much because spoilers.\n\nAlso, I loved Fern. It was great having a main character on the autistic spectrum, but still a fully fleshed-out and nuanced character who equally drives the plot.\n\nHas anyone else here read it already? Did you predict the ending? >!I suspected something was up with Rose and that she was manipulating Fern, but I didn't guess the extent of her lying or responsibility for Billy's death, or the innocence of their mother!!

"Jokes,YZXFILE,A Medieval polish farmer is out working in his fields one day, and digs up an old magic lamp. He begins to wipe off the dirt, thinking to sell it at market, when suddenly a Genie flies out, offering the astonished farmer 3 wishes.,\n\n\"Oh Noble farmer, you have freed me from my prison, and for that I grant you 3 wishes! What say you?\"\n\nThe farmer thinks hard about his first wish, and finally says \"I wish for the Mongol hoard to come invade Poland.\"\n\nThe Genie looks at the farmer, puzzled for a moment, then nods. The entire Mongol hoard then eventually shows up and begins pillaging and looting everywhere. It is a time of great misery and suffering, but the hoard eventually leaves again.\n\nShaken, the Genie asks the farmer for his second wish,\n\"Oh Noble farmer, now that thou hast brought this country to its knees, what is your next wish?\"\n\nThe farmer looks around at the devastation, resolve in his eyes, and says \"Genie, I want the Mongol Hoard to come invade Poland again!\"\n\nThe Genie looks at the man in horror, and starts to argue with him, but then just sighs and snaps his fingers. Eventually, the Mongols arrive once more, and re-destroy the surrounding country. It is another time of great pain and misery for the polish people. Eventually, the Mongols depart once more\n\nShaken by what he has witnessed, the Genie cautiously asks the farmer for his third wish. Without hesitation, the farmer immediately says \"I wish for the Mongols to invade Poland one more time!\"\n\nThe Genie can't believe his ears.\n\"Oh Cruel farmer, why would you wish such misery on your fellow countrymen? What harm and suffering have they heaped on you to make you hate them so?\" the puzzled Genie asks, as he snaps his finger one final time.\n\nThe farmer grins at the Genie. \"Oh, I don't hate my countrymen, I love my friends and neighbors and this country. But every time the Mongols invade us, they go through Russia twice!\",https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/v53vt7/a_medieval_polish_farmer_is_out_working_in_his/,False"

"TwoXChromosomes,80seenone,I want nothing more than to be infertile. I'm tired of womanhood being so closely tied to pregnancy.,Pregnancy and child rearing is a theme that's crawled up my ass since I was born. I can't ever get away from the repetitive messaging that that's all I am or who I am. All I'm good for. Little girls receive baby dolls before they're verbal, and I was made to take care of my baby brothers as a 4th grader. \n\nThen there's of course the obvious sexist aspects of culture or religion, where having babies is my duty and purpose. Can't forget racism and the obsession with white babies, or fetishization and the obsession with mixed babies. That's me, the baby dispenser. \n\nThe very idea and it's association with women just makes me sick to my stomach and uncomfortable.  I loathe watching movies and the female characters are there to have babies. Or even portrayals  of the old days where women were literally assets and property to train and own. Not like we're fully free from that anyways. \n\nI think it's slipped me into an existential crisis. Stop associating me with baby having.  I'm just a human.\n\nI want a witch to come and wiggle her ear at me and turn me into a rock.,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/v53xqn/i_want_nothing_more_than_to_be_infertile_im_tired/,False"

"LifeProTips,outcastedOpal,LPT: When you get an official looking email, check the name AND the email seperately.,Scammers will put an offical email as their name. Sometimes email apps will show you only the name and not the email (looking at you outlook). For example, the name section might say dontreply@bofa.com. When you tap on the name, it will reveal the real email. \n\nAlso, best practices. Dont click a link from any email anyways. If an email tells you about a specific topic, google it. Ex. Bank of america will give you a free toaster if you get another credit card with them and the email says to go to bankofamerica.com/toaster, google \"bank of america toaster\". Even if the top google result is the same, its still safer to click the google link. You can cange what the link says in an email like [this](https://www.google.com). So even though it says [https://www.google.com](https://www4.bing.com) it will send you to anotherwebsite (bing)\n\nI know it might seem like general knowledge but some people will need it.

"movies,movieguy2004,Was Rush Hour 3 that much worse?,I just watched the whole trilogy for the first time over this past week and really enjoyed all of them. They\u2019re really funny and the action is actually pretty cool for the most part. But I don\u2019t think any of them is clearly the best of the bunch. I\u2019m sure if I thought long enough about it, I could probably pick one that I liked the best, but I honestly think they\u2019re all pretty even in terms of quality. Evidently though, that\u2019s not the popular consensus. \n\nAs I\u2019m writing this, the first one has a 61% on Rotten Tomatoes while the second one has a 52%. This suggests to me that both are generally well-liked. To my surprise though, the third one has a measly 17%, implying there were a great deal of people who liked either one or both of the first two but didn\u2019t care for this one. That just doesn\u2019t make a ton of sense to me. I guess I could see how someone would think it\u2019s nominally the worst of the franchise, but I simply didn\u2019t see a dip in quality that warrants such a drop off in critical enjoyment. \n\nThat goes for the whole franchise, really. It\u2019s super tonally consistent as a series so I really think most people who like the first one would like the rest and vice-versa. If anyone really enjoys one or more of them but passionately dislikes one or more of the others, I\u2019d honestly be super curious to hear your reasoning.,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/v54fuy/was_rush_hour_3_that_much_worse/,False"

Couple days ago, I opened Citi checking because I saw another cash bonus promo. I transferred $29.5k from the savings account to my external checking to fund my series I bond and fund this new checking account. I transferred $15k from my external checking to fund the new citi checking as the account reps told me that it has to be \u201cnew money\u201d, meaning I can\u2019t transfer between citi accounts to meet the bonus cash requirement. As soon as the checking was funded yesterday, citi blocked both of my savings and checking accounts. Today, citi fraud prevention dept agent told me that I will receive a letter as to why and check on my balance within 60 days. I\u2019m worried that I might be losing the $15k since the agent can\u2019t confirm if citi has received the funding. My external checking confirmed that money was successfully transferred though.

"tifu,Atorpy,TIFU by picking my nose,So, I recall this was about 6 years ago.\n\nI'd always have the problem of picking my nose because for some reason I was overly congested compared to your average person. And here is where the FU begins. I could recall that something in my mouth at around 11:00 PM, when I was in my bed. I walked up to the sink to spit it out, and I realized that I had spat out blood. I was not so terrified, as I calmly told my parents that I had spat out blood. They immediately rushed to the hospital because of this. they grabbed a red plastic cup that I could spit in. I remember we got at the hospital and stayed in the waiting room at around 11:30. I had to wait around 30 minutes at the emergency room before finally being admitted to the room. I don't recall what I saw during my walk to my room, but I finally got my room, and I was given a better container to spit my blood in. I remember this was at around 2:00 and I threw up a shit ton of blood. I mean is was so fucking scary. It built up so much that I asked my parents to pour it in the sink. The doctor said something about a biohazard and they took it. Anyways the events were vague after that and I got transferred to a children's hospital and stayed there for 7 days before being discharged. \n\nAnyways, I recently found out that my constant picking of my nose might have led my nose to bleed unknowingly into my stomach. So it was the equivalent of my drinking blood, but without it passing through my mouth. Cost my family a decent amount.\n\nTL;DR; Picked my nose, which led it to bleed and have the blood traveled to my stomach, and ended up having myself hospitalized for a week.,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/v54idz/tifu_by_picking_my_nose/,False"

Or both? \n\n**Considerations**\n\n1. Will I be taxed on UK investments in the USA? Vice versa?\n2. If I invest in USA then move back to UK, what are the tax / convenience / feasibility implications of getting invested money out of the USA? \n\n**Notes**\n\nI am not going to worry about the possibility of staying here/splitting time/life between the two countries - that's not the plan, if that changes then I will readjust. \n\nI have reported all my accounts in both UK and USA to our US accountant to include on tax return. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you for any advice!,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/v54orc/brit_in_usa_should_i_invest_here_or_at_home/,False"

We were chatting and randomly came onto the topic of circumcision. \n\nNow, I'm the type of girl who gets a laugh when I see a post where a guy has completely missed the mark on knowing female anatomy. It's silly but in my reasoning, you should know what your doing if you are interested in doing it. I've always been confident in my knowledge of the male anatomy and never felt any reason to question what I knew. \n\nAnyways, while making dinner that came up. I stated confidently - \"I don't think I've ever been with a man who was circumcised\"\n\nMy husband stops dead in his tracks frozen and goes \"excuse me?\". So I stated it again. He's looking at me like I'm pulling a joke on him and I'm gonna tell him I'm kidding. Around that point I realized hmm, maybe I needed to ask an important question - \"wait... Are you circumcised??\"\n\nHe is, he always has been - it lead to a very long and very educational talk after about 10 minutes of laughter. I finally got a run down of circumcision vs. uncut and how the practice began and am humbled beyond belief at how much I had missed the mark.

"movies,Notyourworm,Topgun (1986) is not a good movie,I just watched the original top gun so I could watch the new one without any confusion and I was pretty disappointed. I actually thought it was a bad movie. \n\nFirst, it doesn\u2019t really have a plot. It seems more like a collection of scenes stitched together. Sure, they are at top gun and trying to win this trophy, but it doesn\u2019t really even focus on that. They just show these air fights and some scenes showcasing this conflict with maverick and iceman that doesn\u2019t really go anywhere. Then suddenly goose dies and they graduated. The climax is completely unrelated to the previous portion of the movie beyond the lessons maverick learned which, to me, isn\u2019t a strong enough correlation to make it feel like a natural extension of the movie. Then with the weird romance storyline, the whole movie just felt very disconnected from itself. \n\nSecond, the lack of realism is distracting. I could point out a lot of things, but I\u2019ll focus on a couple. Starting with the romance, maverick (eventually) starts dating one of the teachers (although she was a contractor) of top gun and nobody gives a shit. Then the pure recklessness of maverick throughout and nobody caring. Also the main focus is on winning this trophy instead of, you know, learning how to be a better pilot. The biggest one was them shooting down four Russian planes and it not causing a huge war?! Even if they weren\u2019t actual Russians, an American plane got shot down and the captain was not in hysterics, plus the catapult that launched more planes broke during this and the captain was basically like \u201cthat\u2019s not good.\u201d,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/v553a8/topgun_1986_is_not_a_good_movie/,False"

"tifu,blunt-e,TIFU by scaring the hell out of some poor young woman in my creepg work van.,So I'm attending an out of town expo for work, and get in a day early so that we can drop off the booth stuff and set up. One of my coworkers booked us a couple of hotel rooms at this place near the convention hall downtown, and I drove down for the expo in our company van, which is white, unmarked and has no windows in the back. The hotel ends up being a sort of scam, literally a college dorm that they convert into a hotel for the summer, and use fake pictures to get you to book. Doesn't even look like the building on the Google listing, super tiny hidden sign, sketchy right? \n\nAnyway, I just cannot find this place. Drove by it like three times, thinking \"this just can't be it doesn't look at all like the pictures\". So I park for a minute a block up to call em and get some instructions. While I'm doing so this young woman must have walked past me on the sidewalk. I get guidance throw it in drive and slowly ease up to where they told me to go to see the sign for the garage entrance. I still haven't really noticed (conciously) this girl, I'm peering past her trying to read the sign for the garage, squinting through the afternoon glare. She turns, sees a bald, tatted up white dude, apparently leering at her, in a sketchy white unmarked van that started moving after she walked past it, and turns shock white. Without missing a beat she spins, screams, and sprints away full speed (honestly props to her that was some impressive survival skills.) It takes me a solid 15 seconds for my sleep deprived brain to realize what happened and what it must have seemed like to her! I'm sitting there like oh fuck, what can I do though? I can't go running after her apologizing, so I just park and go check in. Haha I told the front desk employee what happened, saying if the police show up to tell them that I was just a tired, lost dude not creeping I swear!\n\nIn my defense I had left at 5am that day to drive across the whole state, unloaded the van set up an expo booth, and was laser focused on checking in and finding a shower, bed, and a beer. I still feel terrible. Mamn if you're out there, I'm so sorry! It was all a misunderstanding so please don't be forever traumatized by my dumb ass! \n\n\nTLDR: tired me couldn't find his hotel, and inadvertently scared the hell put of some poor woman who thought she was getting Liam Neisan \"taken\",https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/v553mw/tifu_by_scaring_the_hell_out_of_some_poor_young/,False"

The story they tell you isn't the right story.\u00a0\n\nThey just made a more \"kid-friendly\" version so they won't scare the kids. Now, you may not believe me.\u00a0\n\nI understand, but just read this story, for the time being, k? K.\n\nOn the night of Christmas, two kids lie in bed. Susie, the older sister, heard a noise and woke up. She knew it was Santa, so she woke up her little brother Andrew.\u00a0\n\n\"Andrew! C'mon, It's Santa! He's here!\" She said. Her brother got out of bed and they both snuck out of their rooms.\u00a0\n\nThey snuck down the stairs and saw the silhouette of a very large man. They both looked at each other and whispered.\n\n\u00a0\"Santa!\" They quickly but carefully traveled down the stairs and into the living room. They saw the silhouette of... Wait. That's not Santa.\n\n\u00a0It's huge. It has hundreds of sharp teeth and a billion eyes, and it looked slimy and monstrous.\u00a0\n\nThe siblings were scared and shivering from fear. They dove behind the two recliner chairs in the living room.\n\nThey both watched in terror as the creature extended its long tongue and wrapped it around the cup of milk, glugged it, and threw it, shattering it completely in a loud crash.\n\nInstead of extending its tongue, it walked and grabbed the plate of chocolate cookies and dumped them in its mouth, shattering the plate as well.\u00a0\n\nIts slimy tongue licked its large mouth and teeth. The children trembled in fear as terrifying thoughts danced in their heads.\n\nAndrew began crying and the creature heard it. It turned to the recliners and walked toward them, snarling its large teeth.\u00a0\n\n\"Naughty Children, up past bedtime. You should be punished.\" The creature extended its tongue from its mouth and it lunged at Susie but she dodged it.\u00a0\n\nThe children began screaming and crying. They ran up the stairs as the creature crashed into everything chasing after them.\n\nThe kids screamed and they cried and they internally prayed to the gods above that they wouldn't die on this fateful night.\n\nSusie ran as fast as her legs would take her, but Andrew didn't run fast enough. The creature grabbed his leg with its mouth completely tearing his foot.\u00a0\n\nThe monster got ahold of Andrew's head and squeezed it until it popped like a weasel. Screams and cries echoed, Susie only ran faster.\u00a0\n\nShe finally got to her room and dashed it, slamming the door. She climbed into bed hiding under the covers and pretended she was asleep.\n\nHer fear only grew as she heard the bedroom door open and the snarling of the creature. She whimpered and cried out of fear.\n\nThe creature pulled the covers off of her and tried to grab her head but failed instead and scratched her face. Susie grabbed a pencil from the side of the bed and stabbed it in one of its eyes and pulled it out, taking the eyeball with it.\n\nThe creature recoiled in pain and screeched. Susie hid under her covers again shivering and crying.\u00a0\n\nMorning came and the police had already raided the house when Susie awoke. She told the cops everything and they took her to safety.\n\nThey never did find the creature's body though.\u00a0\n\nIt's a shame knowing they didn't believe her and only blamed her for the death of her brother and parents.,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/v554re/santa_the_real_story/,False"

I had been working at this place for years and been saving up the money for me to eventually go to college. I am also some who daily use the instagram on my free time all. I just like to preoccupy my time on there, just scrolling through many pictures and videos. Occasionally dm other on there too. I soon came across a post about gaining more money if I were deposit a check that was given to me. I know I know, I\u2019m so foolish to fall for this. I just really just really want to get out of my crumby job like any one else. So I was stupidly trying to make money fast. What ended up happening, was that I was given three $1,000 checks to deposit. And I eventually did, which led to the scammer withdrawal heavily from my banking account. Which led them to closed my account and placed me reliable for the debts that the scammer cost me. Is there anyway for me to re-gain the money I lost or to at least get rid of this debt I was placed in?\n\nI appreciate any advice on this matter. Sorry if my writing bad.

"TwoXChromosomes,NariVeeTea,\"If this person was a woman everyone would be pissed\",This is a common sentence used when there is a video or a picture, or a story about a man being flirted with, groped or sexualised in some way by a woman. \n\nThere was a post not too long ago talking about how Thor is shown naked and being used as eye candy for the female audience. The post talked about the double standards and how if a woman was in that position, everyone would be up in arms. \n\nNow in theory, yes the double standard is unfair, BUT, I have a question for the men who point this out: are you just as mad when you see society or media doing the same to women? \n\nWhen a woman is portrayed in unnecessarily revealing clothing, when a woman is being harassed in public, when a woman's character is raped or killed to push a male character's narrative forward, are you just as mad? Or are you just trying to poke holes in women's arguments and delegitimize their anger? \n\nSomething tells me you're the same type of person that try to derail a woman's discussion on sexual assault by saying \"well men are raped too!\" \n\nYou don't actually give a damn about men being sexualized or harrased, you want to win an argument, you want to try and prove a point.

His gross is about 158k a year and net is about 130k, so our take home is about 10k a month ( love Texas due to no state tax haha). My biggest concern is our grocery budget, not necessarily because I have a problem with it, but I'm more so confused and would like to be enlightened as to how some people spend ridiculously little amounts on groceries. I see numbers such as 500 to feed a family of 5 and I'm flabbergasted. I don't buy pre packaged anything, I'm an avid, almost pro cook and make absolutely everything from scratch. Only packaged item is broth as I'd rather die than cook my rice or pasta with just water lol\nI know we buy lots of fresh fruit and veggies, but how are some people spending so little, are they just eating beans and rice ? How are some families spending 300 to feed a family of four!  Lastly, based on the breakdown below, is my grocery budget realistic? Too much? Too little? I would love to spend less and save more on food, but is that even possible without sacraficing good food and veggies and meat and fish?. OH and we don't eat out unless on vacation or we're going to be out all day. \nOur main bills are ..\nRent 1850\nCar 883\nCar insurance 103\nLofe insurance 60\nDisability insurance 230\nCredit car bills, debt, and student loans ( I have a graduate science degree), 1500 a months \n2 kids in diapers and one on formula ( 400 a month for formula and 200 a month for diapers for 2 plus about 60 a month for wipes )\nInternet 90\nEnergy 200ish \nWater 65\nParking 70\nValet trash 35 ( can't get out of this one)\nGroceries 1400 with toiletries \n\nI'm not including fun expenses or clothing expenses ( we spend very little on clothes and shoes because I'm very much a minimalist, so even though we do buy ourselves and our kids high end clothing, it's very very little of it),https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/v557gw/need_to_fit_groceries_in_this_budget_in_a/,False"

"personalfinance,HoneyBadgett,My Girlfriend wants to take out a $15,000 loan in search of a car.,My girlfriend is in need of a car bar next year as she is going into her second year of college and living off campus. She will also need it to get to work. She is considering taking out a $15,000 loan for a car. I don't think its the best decision as she's only 19 but maybe I'm wrong. I want to know the best way to buy an affordable good mileage car without taking that big of a financial leap. She said the loan would last 5 years. Her dad offered to pay 100 dollars off each bill. He wants her to build credit with the loan. Not a clue what the interest rate would be. She's currently employed working at 11 dollars an hour. She has around $1935 total in her bank. She is currently doing a paid internship where she's going to make around $1200 for 3 weeks of work. That ends this weekend. She doesn't know her schedule where she is currently employed due to the internship. As of right now her college is being paid for but not sure if that's going to continue as her parents might not be able to financial support it. She is also paying for her phone bill which is around $81.50 a month. She starts paying her lease for her apartment in August at around 405 per month with a year contract. When she gets to college she will have a job that pays her 13.50 an hour with as many hours as she needs. She also will have to factor in money that goes towards food. Any advice with what she should do? And if she were trying to get a 15,000 dollar loan what interest rate should she be trying to get and how long should it be.

"tifu,Burneraccount8264,TIFU by spending $1k at the casino because I have a crush on the dealer,Hi everyone, so today I went to the casino which I typically only do once every couple months BUT lately it's been like 3 times a week because I have the biggest crush on one of the dealers. It's like the highlight of my day seeing him, granted I'm lonely so anyone who's forced to be friendly to me I enjoy being around lol. So far going to the casino has been fine for me, I've never done worse than breaking even and surprisingly I usually win. Today the casino was EMPTY, I'm talking like two people at the most at any table. The dealer I like was at high card flush and no one else was there, therefore I went to high card flush. I told myself there was ZERO chance I spend more than $300 but I went through that amount so quickly and I was having an amazing time talking to him one on one, yes I know he's paid to be there and that it's probably not mutual but that doesn't change how enjoyable I find it. Next thing you know it's closing time and I've lost a fucking grand. Now that realization has kicked in I'm like DAMN that's literally a month of rent just to talk to some guy. Clearly now I regret dropping so much money but I got SO caught up in the moment. I guess more casinos need to hire young attractive guys because I never thought anyone could make me lose so much in a night\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f also on a side note, sorry for my poor grammar\n\nTLDR: Went to the casino and spent a months rent just to talk to a dealer I have a crush on,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/v558zn/tifu_by_spending_1k_at_the_casino_because_i_have/,False"

I currently make $70k annually and WFH so I have an annual mileage usage under $10,500. My car (used 2012 Subaru Forester) is used solely for pleasure. I have looked at Wawanesa, Farmers, and AAA. Allstate's website is not allowing me to enter in multiple traffic violations so I wasn't able to get a quote from them. I got a speeding ticket for going 7 over in March 2021 and another one in February 2017 for going (I think) 15 over? Of course, this is affecting the quotes. For each custom policy, I am including the following:\n\n\nBodily Injury (BI) and Property Damage (PD) Liability - $100k/$300k/$100k\n\n\nUninsured / Underinsured Motorist Bodily Injury (UMBI) - $100/$300k\n\n\nMedical Payments - No Coverage (because I have health insurance through work)\n\n\nComprehensive - $500\n\n\nCollision - $1,000\n\n\nRental - $0 (I work from home)\n\n\nRoadside Assistance - $0 (I have AAA)\n\n\nI have heard that Wawanesa is the best in California but they are quoting me $1,623.51 (6 months paid up front) and then I am assuming $270 every month. Farmers is saying $320.83 and AAA is quoting me $187.66. Basically I am wondering if I am missing anything or if I have covered all my bases here. I have no idea if these quotes are fair and reasonable or, if I have missed something or am including something I shouldn't, that would affect the rates. I am fairly dumb and this stuff is honestly confusing the shit out of me but I really need insurance ASAP so I would appreciate guidance!,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/v559ed/first_time_shopping_for_car_insurance_i_am/,False"

We are Alaskans and get an annual pfd per person. We have finally made it to a place in life where I can afford to save the kid's PDF money for their future lives. Last year I put (then 9yo) pfd into a 5 year CD at like 3% (baby didn't get a pfd due to not being born early enough in the year to file for them).\n\nI see advertising for alaska 529 plans but worry that it may not be the best choice. I want the kids to use their money however they want when they are old enough. Not just for school. Should I do more CDs for this year's pfd, start an ak529, or something else? I heard rates are much higher now.\n\nFor husband and I, we both have 401k's we contribute to and we both have Roth IRA. He maxes out contribution but I only do about 2,500 since I'm very part time wfh sahm. We also have a savings account specifically set up for a future home down payment. We currently rent super cheap from mother in law. I also have 20pay whole life policies for each of the kids (idk if that matters).\n\nAny advice is super appreciated!,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/v55dls/best_way_to_save_alaskan_pfd_for_kids_future/,False"

I am tired of hearing them say their reason to be against abortion is, \"Oh because it is murder\" and yet follow an apparently \"loving god\" who is believed to commit genocide multiple times and kill babies but be okay with it. \n\nCherry-picking\nYou can probably see where this is going. Lots of Christians (and others) pick out random verses from their bibles that they want to use against others and ignore the rest. Sure there may be a few verses against \"homosexuality\" but there's much more about loving one another and treating each other as one, but no screw those. \n\nChild abuse:\nSeeing religious parents tell their children that they are worthless and sinners is quite fucked up if you ask me. No child deserves lies shoved down their throats. I've seen a bunch of fucked up shit that religious parents do to their children for not matching their beliefs and it's just horrible.\n \nWTF verses:\nThe Bible literally has a lot of messed up writings in it. The Bible is called the \"good book\" yet commands slavery, sexism, abuse, virgin's worth, rape, and whatever. It's disgusting and honestly the God in the book doesn't sound like a \"Loving God\" worth worshiping. If God's words and shit is apparently in the Bible and yet is written that he supports the things mentioned, then what evil is \"Satan\"? Besides, the stories in the Bible includes a bunch of unbelievable things that are obviously fake and yet I'm \"broken\" for not believing a talking snake and some other bullshit.\n\nAbleism:\nAs someone with mental and physical issues, I am tired of the thing religious people say about us. I am not \"possessed\" or \"a curse\" for having these problems. I noticed that \"God\" isbelieved to have all the power and plans for someone's life so that means he allowed kids to get things like cancer. Quite sadistic, don't you think? It's silly to see that the believers would pray to the same God that allowed the problem to happen in the first place.\n\nI can continue the list on and on but these are just a couple examples so far. Far too many religious believers are a bunch of delusional, bigoted hypocrites and I really think the world would be a better place if the modern religions would fade away like the ancient ones.,https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/v55ifv/rantvent_religion_is_one_of_the_most_inhumane/,False"

"TwoXChromosomes,GamerGurl3980,Something my date did the other night BLEW MY MIND!,So I've (21F) been getting back into dating lately. I met this one guy (27M) off Bumble and we hit it off. We went on our first date on Thursday. We spent like 4-5 hours together, getting to know each other and such. They were great!\n\nWe then went to a resturant later in the day and when I got my drinks (water and a pink lemonade), I needed to go use the bathroom. But I didn't trust him enough to leave my drink unattended. I tried to cover it with my cloth napkin but obviously - that wouldn't stop him if he tried to drug me. \ud83e\udd23\n\nI said how I'd just wait until I get home to use the bathroom (since the resturant was only a few minutes away from my house). When our waiter came back to us, my date proceeded to say to the waiter:\n\n\"Hey, it's our first date. Can you take her drinks and hold them while she goes to the bathroom and bring them back when she gets back?\"\n\nWHEN I TELL YOU IN MY HEAD MY JAW DROPPED!!!! I have NEVER had a guy do that for me before or I've never heard of any guy doing that with any woman before! I know some of you are probably thinking \"That's the bare minimum\". Well, he went out of his way to ask the waiter to HOLD MY DRINKS to assure me that I would be safe with him. That was amazing to me personally.\n\nWe had a great date and had another one tonight (Saturday).

"nosleep,Bwithered,something weird happened at my fathers property... (part 2),Im sitting on my loungroom couch as my eyes roll into soft, meaningful tears. As the person on the phone tells me that my father has just passed away, my memories fill my brain as the thought of loss kicks in. In a depreesed state of conciousness, i roll into the fetal position as i hang up the phone with a regretful anger, and all i could do was go to sleep, nothing else, theres nothing else you can do once you find out one of your most fond parents passes away.\n\nThey say he died of a heart attack, he was just lying down on his bed and suddenly just died, its weird how that happens? Just a few weeks later i have moved into the place where my father lived, since it was on his will i have this place all to myself with every single belonging of his still sitting inside that damn property of his. This place gave me nightmares and for a good reason. I know this place has a dark secret. And for a 28 year old to be scared of something wasnt really normal, but this place, this darn place is going to have some issues.\n\nAs i sit down on the fancy rocking chair my dad always sat on, something catches my eyesight, it was a box?\nObviously for someone who wants drama, i open the box which was laying just above the fridge, honestly it looked like it was dragging me towards it because of its some sort of evil look. It was those keys? The keys from over a decade ago, them keys that was some of the reason to give me nightmares. I pick up the keys to inspect them properly. It was a mix of little keys and big keys and one singular car key, it wasnt a modern car key, it looked like a really really old car key, like a key that belonged to a car from the 1950's\n\nI look at what seems to be a small engraving on the car key, it looked like eagle wings but they looked really large to be eagle wings, the engraver mustve done a sh*t job trying to do an eagle representation. I put the keys in my pocket and head outside, jump in my car and head to the nearest mall where an antique collector was located. I open the very dusty looking door, looking like it hadnt been opened for months. The store receptionist greets me with a very polite tone, i make a small smile to that because i have never heard anyone that polite before. \"Hello\" i say to the receptionist, \"i have this old looking set of keys, mind if you have a look?\" I ask. The receptionist nods with a smile. He pulls up a magnifying glass and begins to look at the keys. \n\nI turn around to have a look at all of the antiques, but was quickly inturupted when the receptionist tells me the car keys belong to a 1950 ford. \"That was quick?\" I say to the receptionist. The receptionists nods and points to the marking on the keys, \"you live on that property of your dads dont you?\" He says staring straight at me with a blank face, i nod. He doesnt say a word until i go to turn around, i was feeling really creeped out by this guy at this point. I go to leave but was inturupted again when he says \"that place is the meaning of damn hell, if you dont leave you will turn out just like your father\" he says in a rough voice, i could tell he was meaning it but i grab the keys from the counter and run out of there.\n\nWhen i get back to the property, i want to take a nice relaxing walk where the treeline sat. As im walking i get the feeling of something watching me, and it got to the point where i full on stopped infront of the treeline. As im standing there i hear a slow muffled voice come from the middle of the forest, it was really quiet and discrete. Thats when i noticed it was really silent, the memory of the night when i was 14 comes back to me. I want to run but i cant, im stuck in the exact spot. When the voice became to loud to comprehend, i snap out of my trans and all of the noises came back, insects were croaking and birds were chirpimg again. I didnt want to but it was pulling me in, the forest called to me, so i answered. I was walking in the forest and about 100 metres into it, i seen a car? It was a old ford, the same model the receptionist told me about.\n\nI observe the car, it has been rusted into pure dust and its wheels were no where to be seen but the key hole was shiny as a chrome plated sliver spoon. All i could do was use the keys in the car, as i sat on the leather seats i bend down and put the keys into the car and i feel this awful sense of dread when i do so. Something grabs my shoulder and i flinch back out of the car but nothing was there, i run back to the house, with every tree seeming like it wants to kill me and the ground now shaking like a car starting, tears run down my face because i have never been so scared in my life. When i run out of the treeline, everything stops.\n\nThe only thing i notice is nothing was on the property anymore, no house, no car in the driveway and no shed. Thats when a thunderous crash comes from where the house was suppost to be, it was a plane, a damn world war 2 plane came crashing down on the property, as soon as it crashes, everything shifts, it was like a timelapse of time going past. The house was now built but it was really new, like it had just been built. It was night time and i seen a couple standing on the portch of the house, then something runs from the left of the house, it was this unhumanly long creature with really long arms that thrust itself towards the couple. \n\nThe image of blood and guts being squirted everywhere fills my mind. And i see the man gets into the same car that was in the forest, ive never seen a car so new before. He starts the car up but the creature jumps onto the car and violently tries to grab the man, it succeeds, and the car goes running straight into the forest, but it wasnt a forest, it was just grass and the car gets stopped by the creature and it visciously tears apart the man. Time changes again and i feel different, im in the treeline and i see... myself? \"I\" was sitting on the portch with my dog and i had keys in my hand, i was holding them up but i couldnt feel anything, i couldnt control it. The thing that was in me made a quick turn as the dog next to \"me\" started barking, i hang up the keys on a branch and i run to the car.\n\nI jumped underneath the car, and underneath the car was this hole, it lead down to a huge connection of tunnels that looked like they stretched on for miles. Thats when i snap back into present time. I lay on the ground and start to cry, but i remember this place isnt safe anymore, im not safe anymore, i run to the house where i barge through the front door, i get my hand up above the door and grabs my dads shotgun, i face towards the treeline and see the monster again, its smiling. I put the shotgun up to my head and in one last moment i see the monster hold up those damn keys again, i cant deal with this anymore, i could hear the monster talk to me as if he was saying to \"do it\".\n\nI wake up, the hostpital lights flicker and the soft white pillow comforts my head. \"Hes awake!\" One of the nurses yell. Everyone comes and and stares at me with an exciting smile. \"What... happened?\" I say in a slow tone. \"You were in a coma\" one of the people from the crowd says. \"You crashed your plane sir, you are so licky you survived!\" Another person says. I blink, confused, i try to get up but thats when i notice it wasnt... \"what date is it?!\" I scream. One of the men point at the calendar and says \"21st of may 1949, we won the war!\".

"nosleep,ACEZANNE,Moloch's Child,No one paid a thought to the man with no skin.\n\nI\u2019ve been sitting in the middle of this busy square for an hour, and not a single soul has given any indication that they see this anatomical abomination. Let me take a step back:\n\nMy name\u2019s Paul, and I\u2019m a writer. A failing writer, but a writer nonetheless. I haven\u2019t been able to write anything for months, and so I decided to turn back to an old habit: People Watching. I remember my old Creative Writing Professor mentioning that observing people and trying to create stories about them could help jumpstart the creative flow. So, last week I grabbed a notebook and headed to a random street corner. Not much happened. I spent the rest of that week going from corner to corner until I found this spot outside a business skyscraper.\n\nRush hour was a perfect time, so I got there a little early and waited. It started slow enough: a businesswoman in a maternity blouse waddled out and made her way to a hatchback on the large side and drove off; nothing too interesting there. Ten minutes later, a Hispanic man in a navy tracksuit swaggered past me wearing one of those Bluetooth earpieces that were so popular in the mid-2000s. He was saying something in a language that wasn\u2019t Spanish, and the tone sounded very sarcastic. \u201cOkay, that\u2019s interesting enough.\u201d I thought to myself as I began jotting down random thoughts about him. I paused to look up and find another person to make a character, and that\u2019s when I noticed him.\n\nI don\u2019t know when he showed up; If he walked or just apparated, but across the street was a man with no skin. \n\nAt first, I thought it was a terrifyingly intricate costume. The curves of the musculature, the stringy veins, and bulging joint tissue all reminded me of an Anatomy and Physiology model. That theory was dashed once it opened its mouth. Two rows of bleach-white teeth separated allowing an impossibly long tongue to snake out and plop onto the dirty concrete.\n\nI looked around both sides of the street both curious and concerned: curious if anyone else could see him, and concerned for myself when I realized no one else could. The long appendage twitched twice before a bus blew past obscuring my view. Once the leviathan of public transportation finishes its pass, which only took a few seconds, the figure was gone. Everyone continued about their day not once stopping to consider an anatomical impossibility that had been there one second and gone the next. I wrote a quick note about the mysterious figure and quickly made my way home.\n\nThe impossible - and frankly implausible - sight continued to stroke my curiosity and filled me with intriguing dreams that night. Dreams of anatomical figurines marching through some stock broker\u2019s office in jerky mechanical movements; each flex of muscle accompanied by a rasping scream as they file through the office stopping to lick each regular worker in their face. I woke up exhausted the next morning.\n\nI wasn\u2019t in my bed. I was at my desk with a partially written manuscript beneath my head. Did I write in my sleep?\n\nThis was odd, even with the neurotic things I did in my college years. I rubbed my eyes, made a pot of coffee, and looked at this mysterious manuscript. It was full of incoherent ramblings about the universe\u2019s edge, and time escaping, and ended with the mention of a pharaoh from before this world\u2019s existence\u2026\n\nWhatever that means. I shake off the weirdness and set the manuscript aside. I thought it was interesting enough to deal with later. After eating breakfast, I decided to head back to the area where I saw the figure. There wasn\u2019t anything left behind on the sidewalk; no dripping, no blood, not even a strange footprint. I was about ready to just chock it and the manuscript up to an unusually high burst of creativity and neuroses when I saw it again. It was about ten feet away from me, but I could see its eyes: empty sclera staring seemingly aimless, but as its mouth slowly opened and that impossible tongue lolled out; I could tell there was something it was looking for. \n\nThe tongue twitched on the ground before slowly lifting off the ground and moving in a way that reminded me of a Moray Eel. The sound of a car alarm being set snatches my attention from the abomination in front of me. It\u2019s the pregnant woman from yesterday. Judging by the easily visible bump in her oversized blouse I\u2019d say she was about six months in. She rushes by in an uncomfortable shuffle completely ignorant of the thing in front of me.\n\nCRACK\n\nThe sound snaps my attention back to the strange figure.\n\nIts head has turned to completely face the building despite its torso facing me still. The tongue bisects at the end revealing exaggerated canines. The long extremity darts directly for the woman. Unconsciously, I shout a warning to the woman.\n\n\u201cWatch out!\u201d I scream.\n\nShe ducks her head in an awkward dodge and looks around. As she investigates the tongue appears to pierce through her back, but there\u2019s no blood; no viscera, no gore; not even a wince of pain from the woman as the tongue snaps back to the abomination.\n\nThe woman\u2019s eyes meet mine, and she scoffs before flipping me off and entering the building. I look back at the thing, but it\u2019s completely gone; once again missing without a single trace of its existence. Shakily, I cross the street and drop onto the bench I had sat on yesterday trying to process my possible insanity.\n\nTen minutes later, an ambulance screeches to a halt across the street. Paramedics rush in, and minutes later they come out with the pregnant woman on a stretcher. Blood covers her mouth, chin, and skin-tone stockings.\n\nShaken by the result I rush over to the building, burst into the lobby, and inquire as to what happened.\n\nThe woman behind the counter can\u2019t seem to pull her tear-filled eyes from a wide puddle of blood sitting just outside one of the elevators\u2026\n\nThe woman miscarried.\n\nI don\u2019t know exactly how long it took me to get home. The trip between the building, and my home is a blur. I don\u2019t eat that night; my appetite was completely vacant.\n\nI glance at the unfinished manuscript on my desk; I think of all its allusions to bulls made of bronze and sacrifices that \u201cwill leave the birthers to do naught but weep.\u201d I think of what I saw just hours earlier. An itch covers my hand as the unconscious urge to continue writing battles for supremacy in my mind- my soul.\n\nI feel beyond accomplished and relieved as I put it through the shredder. I go to bed that night prepared for any number of nightmares about that creature or the manuscript, but my sleep is dreamless. Hellishly so.\n\nI woke up just a few minutes ago, and I wish I hadn\u2019t.\n\nOutside my second-story window is that thing. As motionless as it would be standing on solid ground not hovering outside a second-story window. It\u2019s watching me with those pure white eyes; focused on my form watching me for something. It tilts its head to the side like some predatory animal, but there\u2019s something different about it\u2026\n\nIt has skin.\n\nIt looks like me. Almost a perfect copy with the exception that there isn\u2019t a single follicle of hair on its smooth body.\n\nI\u2019m typing this out in hopes that if I survive this night someone knows what it is.\n\nIts tongue is tapping on my window; its teeth scraping against the window.\n\nPlease Help,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/v55n0a/molochs_child/,True"

"nosleep,RandomCluelessTeen,The Eclipsia Ritual,A folktale from a village up north speaks of the Eclipsal Ritual. Listen closely, for this village has since migrated elsewhere unknown and this is the last remaining copy of it.\u00a0\n\nThe Eclipsal Ritual may seem fabricated to your\u00a0eyes, but reality is relative.\n\nThe Eclipsal Ritual is a method for someone to grant themself a wish\u00a0by meeting the Deity\u00a0that the village worshipped and asking her for their wish. The Ritual\u00a0can be very easily completed or near impossible, but regardless the first step is to enter a deep trance through meditation.\n\nAs a sorceress, I have been rejected by the village and now walk through this empty home alone. I look after their empty fields as penance, but this is penance not for my sorcery but for people lost long ago to the ritual. If the only way to share this warning\u00a0is to an ear that refuses to hear\u00a0it as anything more than fiction, I am\u00a0willing.\u00a0\n\nI have ensnared\u00a0memories\u00a0from some\u00a0already lost to the Eclipsal Ritual; this is my shrine to the fallen. Come visit me if you need what you call evidence, I will show you the macabre visions I see every night.\u00a0\n\nI have spent so long trying to convince others not to fulfill the Ritual in their desperate bids for luxury, but\u00a0my attempts have only earned my sorcery's exile from the *new* village, so far away from where we once all lived. Where the other villagers once lived.\n\nBut they have cast me, the Sorceress, the one person who knows *anything* of what happens in that\u00a0trance, away from the rest of the village. They left when I was in the forest gathering herbs. They only left me a crumpled\u00a0letter about their migration.\n\nIt didn't tell me where they were migrating to.\n\nMy past may seem fabricated to your\u00a0eyes, but reality is relative.\n\nI will describe\u00a0the memories housed in the shrine honoring those lost to the Ritual. Believe them to be fictional, or not, but heed my warning against committing this Ritual.\u00a0  \n\n\nThe memories are from the eyes of each victim.\n\nCase #1: Amaya\n\n\\[Amaya appears to have had\u00a0already commenced the meditation before the start of this memory.\\] \n\n*The\u00a0vision from the memory\u00a0is black for three minutes until light floods the entire view. A figure crouches\u00a0in the middle of the light but only its silhouette\u00a0is visible. The light dims, and the figure's features are clearer.\u00a0The figure's features are impossible to describe as they phase in and out.*\u00a0\n\n*Amaya\u00a0lets out a scream.*\n\nAmaya: You- you have flowers growing out of your sockets!\u00a0\n\nFigure:\u00a0Why have you come?\n\nAmaya: I...I wish to complete the Eclipsal Ritual.\n\n*The figure appears to laugh.*\n\nFigure: Eclipse was what they called me. They called me a Deity.\n\nAmaya: You...you are the Deity that my village\u00a0worships?\n\nFigure: Yes. I...\n\n*Amaya seems to have taken a step forward as the view\u00a0moved closer. The figure freezes mid-sentence, then collapses and vomits black liquid.*\n\nAmaya: Oh my god.\n\n*Amaya starts hyperventilating.*\u00a0\n\nFigure: Do you know why I'm a Deity, child?\n\n*The feature earlier described by Amaya phases back into view. The flowers are rotting.*\n\nAmaya: Oh- oh god this was a mistake-\n\nFigure: Your village sacrificed my innocence, my *life,*\u00a0for my\u00a0deification. I was always a good child, the very embodiment of perfect.\u00a0\n\nAmaya: Please, I'm so sorry, please just let me go home. I didn't know.\n\nFigure: You have come for a wish. But you are not worthy.\u00a0\n\nThe vision blurs slightly at the edges.\n\nFigure: I will grant you peace. Nothing more, nothing less.\n\nAmaya: What? Oh my god thank you thank you-\n\nFigure: Sleep now, child.\n\n*All light is extinguished. Amaya's cries are silenced.*\n\nFigure (supposedly): You had a dark soul. But rest now, child. This is something\u00a0I was never given, so cherish it.\n\nAmaya's cause of death is listed as a heart attack.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCase #2: Sierra\u00a0\n\n\\[Sierra appears to have had\u00a0already commenced the meditation before the start of this memory.\\] \n\n*The\u00a0vision from the memory\u00a0is black for five\u00a0minutes until light floods the entire view. A figure crouches\u00a0in the middle of the light but only its silhouette\u00a0is visible.*\u00a0\n\nSierra: Have you seen my sister?\n\nFigure: Why have you come?\n\nSierra: To find my sister. Where is she? She...she left us after she went through this ritual.\n\nFigure: Your family claims it to be a coincidence. Do you not trust them?\n\nSierra: I do, but...but I still want her back.\n\nThe light dims, and the figure's features are clearer.\u00a0\n\nFigure: Such purity.\n\nSierra: I'm sorry?\n\nFigure: Speak, child. What is your wish?\n\nSierra: I told you, I just want Amaya back. She's my sister.\n\nFigure: I see. Step closer, child.\n\n*Amaya seems to have taken a step forward as the view\u00a0moved closer. The figure collapses and vomits\u00a0white liquid.*\n\nSierra, after a minute of silence, in a tentative tone: Are you okay?\n\nFigure: I apologise, child.\n\nSierra: ...You can't bring my sister back?\n\nFigure: I have waited far too long for my peace. I cannot give up this chance.\n\nSierra: What do you mean?  \n\n\nFigure: Only a pure soul may be deified.\n\n*The light suddenly grows much, much brighter. Only the\u00a0silhouette of the figure is visible.*\n\nFigure: My life, my\u00a0*soul,* was sacrificed so I may become a god. Every moment in this cursed existence... I have grown weary of these chains.\n\nSierra: Wait, wait please don't-\n\nFigure: And as follows, only a pure soul may take over them.\n\n*Sierra screams.*\n\n*The view moves downward, revealing a wound\u00a0in her chest. No\u00a0blood\u00a0leaks out.*\n\nFigure: Goodbye. I wish you luck in your new duties.\n\n*Sierra screams again.*\u00a0\n\n*The view fades away, but the audio remains.*\n\n*Sierra, supposedly: What did she do to me?\u00a0I....it's so loud. I hear everything. It\u00a0hurts- it hurts it hurTS\u00a0EVERYTHING HURTS-*\n\nCloser examination discovered that plants had\u00a0sprouted into Sierra's heart, killing her instantly. A new scar was also found on her chest.\n\nHer cause of death is listed as divine intervention.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCase #3: Qiana\n\n*The\u00a0vision from the memory\u00a0is black for five\u00a0minutes until light floods the entire view. A figure crouches\u00a0in the middle of the light but only its silhouette\u00a0is visible.*\u00a0\n\nQiana: I come to ask for a wish.\n\n*The light dims, and the figure's features are clearer.\u00a0The figure's features are impossible to describe as they phase in and out.*\u00a0\n\n*The figure appears to cry.*\n\nQiana: ...I.... *\\[Qiana exhales\\]*...I\u00a0wish for immortality.\n\n*Qiana steps forward. The figure appears to then collapses\u00a0and vomits grey liquid.*\n\n*Qiana hesitates.*\u00a0\n\n*The figure appears to beckon to Qiana with an outstretched hand(?). A single violet\u00a0gem in it\u00a0phases into sight.*\n\nFigure: Take it quickly.\u00a0\n\n*Qiana steps forward, grabbing the gem. The figure appears to scream. Qiana rips out the gem.*\u00a0\n\nThe figure, shrieking: Consume it! Consume it and gain your wish before I drain your life away, you ingrate!\n\n*Qiana stares at the gem, then consumes it.*\n\nI gained immortality. The ritual worked.\u00a0\n\nBut the Deity's\u00a0scream\u00a0haunts me every night. Of course, I had already done my own investigation and seen the others'\u00a0memories, so her scream only joined the chorus of despair.\n\nI wonder if it was worth it. I only asked for immortality to warn others of the Eclipsia Ritual.\n\nBut I'm so tired now.\n\nI see why the first Deity, Eclipse, saw death as freedom. Is it not a respite from this hellish reality?  \n\n\nOf course, reality is relative, so you may not think similarly.\n\nBut I do.  \n\n\nI saw with my own eyes how much the Deity suffers. I've seen those rotting blossoms crawl out of her eyesockets. I've seen the clots splay outside her white veins.  \n\n\nBeing a god was never a gift, never something to be celebrated. Or maybe it is; maybe\u00a0gods above us all laugh and bath in righteous\u00a0glory, but not the Deity. Maybe this is punishment for the murder of Eclipse from so long ago.\u00a0  \n\n\nBut this, is this not punishment enough? For crimes from so long ago? Was it long ago? I don't know, immortality blurred reality.\u00a0  \n\n\nI think I released a spell one\u00a0day to remove everyone's memory of the Eclipsia Ritual, and with it any memories of me, Sierra, Amaya,\u00a0Eclipse and any other soul lost to the\u00a0Ritual. They no longer know me as Qiana, but as the Sorceress. I compelled them to move elsewhere- did I? I don't know. What's the time? I- how long have I been here typing? Why am I typing anyway?  \n\n\n...Oh. Of course. I was documenting the Eclipsia Ritual.\u00a0  \n\n\nThis will be the last document about it, I have destroyed all other traces of it. Believe it fiction, or not, but the Eclipsia Ritual dies with me one way or the other.\u00a0  \n\n\nDo your part, I beg of you. Don't ever let anyone else complete the Ritual. I'll do my part,\u00a0erasing everyone who have already completed it.  \n\n\nI'm prepping to complete the ritual one last time.\u00a0I'm going to meet Sierra, or whichever soul was forced into\u00a0deification after her. I'm going to ask for one more wish.\n\nPreviously, I asked for life.\u00a0\n\nThis time, I'm begging for death.,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/v55q0o/the_eclipsia_ritual/,False"

"gaming,Demo-The-PAN,How do you feel about any PvE games getting balance patches?,When I say balance patches, it's what you expect: Buffs and nerfs to aspects of the game to make it more enjoyable. PvP balance is to make sure everyone is on a level playing field and that nothing is too broken or too weak. But how does this apply to PvE? It's only players going against bots so why does it matter if players are overpowered? It's the most common argument against PvE getting any kind of balance patches and I feel like this falls flat hard for multiple reasons.  \n\n\nThe point of balance patches is to, like stated earlier, change parts of the game to make sure nothing is too weak or too OP. So what happens if there's a consistent OP strategy that everyone can easily do? People abuse that strategy for easy wins, this gets even worse in Co-op games as now you will always see people running the same strategy. Let's take Payday 2 as an example, they have a history of reworking and changing skills so they can become not only viable and fun but also not broken. Silencer skills are too powerful and common? Remove the important one that buffs damage and compensate by buffing every gun's damage. Now how about the Binding of Isaac? Let's buff underused characters and items to make them more fun to play with.  \n\n\nBalancing PvE games is just as important as PvP games, but for different reasons. PvP balances are to make sure everyone's on a leveled playing field while PvE balances are focused on making gameplay diverse and challenging. I might be the only person that thinks this, but I want to know how you feel about it.,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/v55szu/how_do_you_feel_about_any_pve_games_getting/,False"
"personalfinance,Time_Huckleberry7102,31 yrs old no savings/ poor credit. want to work towards buying a home and retirement,Like the title says, I'm 31 and far behind. My goal is to become financially stable and eventually become a home owner. All around just take control over my life. \n\nI work as a server in a busy restaurant but I'm not trying to make a career out of it. Pay is decent, averaging roughly $700-$900 a week, sometimes more depending on the season.  I don't have many bills at the moment, currently $600 a month for rent and utilities (live with my partner and split housing bills). Bought my car with cash, no monthly payment, no subscriptions. I pay child support weekly, coming to $400 a month. \n\nI've always been bad at saving but getting slightly better, definitely need more self discipline but I think I'm building it. \n\nMy Equifax score is 545 and I would like to build it but don't really know how to go about doing that the smart way. I wasted a lot of time now I feel like I'm playing catch up\n\nReally considering going to school or learning a trade, I like computers so I thought maybe something in software/coding would be a good idea.

"gaming,MrSpiffy123,Hot take: Glitchless and No Major Glitches Speedruns are Much More Fun to Watch Than a Super Glitchy Any%,Don't worry, I can appreciate the effort that goes into any kind of speedrun, but I just hate watching speedruns where the game has major, game-breaking glitches that are used. Half of the time, you can't watch the damn speedrun because the camera gets fucked up out of bounds or there's just so much shit happening on screen you don't know you're meant to be looking at.\n\nThe best example of my argument is the original Portal. Glitchless and NMG are incredible to watch, seeing the player fling themselves to platforms are carefully throw cubes onto buttons to save time. It takes skill and you can see that mastery at work in the speedrun.\n\nIn an any% Portal speedrun, the camera isn't even synced with the player, so the few minutes they actually spend in bounds, the camera is just spinning in every which direction, looking at seemingly random walls, until the player just appears at the end. Even after watching countless videos explain how saving and loading affects portals and how it can desync the camera, I still don't have a fucking clue what I'm supposed to be looking at. I can't appreciate what I'm watching because I have no idea what I'm supposed to be looking at. Even for a new player, who might not know things like prop climbing (jumping on an object in mid-air and grabbing it again), it's not impossible to see what they're doing by just rewatching the clip a few times.,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/v560d8/hot_take_glitchless_and_no_major_glitches/,False"

"books,i-the-muso-1968,Carrie: Stephen King's first novel.,Stephen Kings first novel , 1974's \"Carrie\", was among the several books I've read during my highschool years. An icon of horror that was adapted into a film in 1976 and a story that I found most interesting.\n\nThe tragic and horrific story of the novel's titular main character Carrie White and the life she lived through is compelling; her abusive religious mother, the bullying she was subjected too and the psychic powers she had developed and the eventual and tragic end that would befall her.\n\nThe layout of it is pretty interesting as well. The book is also interspersed with what look articles and testimony about the coming and aftermath of the events that take place in the story. \n\nAsides from the 1976 adaptation there was also (strangely enough) two musical adaptations, one in 1988 and another from 2012. And there was also a 1999 sequel film, a 2002 tv film adaptation and also th 2013 remake.

"personalfinance,MMOearn,My Mom wants to buy a house and her finances are a disaster.,Hello everyone. My Mother has been talking about buying a house for over a year. I bought a house in 2020 and ever since then she brings up the fact that she wants to buy a house in every encounter we have.\nShe lives with her boyfriend who is on disability and makes $2200 a month. She used to work full time but every since she met this guy she has decided that she's \"retired\" and works 4 days a week 6 hours a day. She makes roughly $15k a year before taxes. Total household income for them is under $40k. She has no 401k or savings to speak of. They live paycheck to paycheck. They spend irresponsibly. She thinks she can buy a house in today's market if she can save a few thousand dollars. As her son I cannot bring myself to tell her the reality of buying a house in 2022. She still thinks it's 1998 when she was able to build a home on 3 acers of land for $150k and $5k down. (lost it to foreclosure) \n\nHow would you guys handle this situation?  I feel like she is going to ask me to borrow money for a down payment on her house eventually. I don't know how to approach basically crushing her dreams of home ownership.

Anytime I tried, I kept seeing that terrible eyeball. Was I hallucinating? Was my starvation finally coming to a head? Was I just really dehydrated? I chugged some water at the thought. I couldn't decide if I should go to the hospital or what I'd even tell them if I did. Do I say I'm having some kind of mental break? Do I say I'm concerned about my ED? I was long past being afraid to bring it up with doctors and dentists... I'd been completely candid with all my healthcare providers for years. And anyway, fuckin dentists always know a bulimic when they see those slowly spreading tips of worn down enamel. Always. There is absolutely no fooling those weird mouth lovin motherfuckers. Sorry, getting off track. More on that another day.  \n\n\nAnyway, I considered calling around and admitting myself somewhere. Maybe it would be best to be hospitalized for a little while. Just to get some fluids and rest. But they would probably put on a feeding tube, and that feels violating in ways I would've never imagined before my first one. And unfortunately I've had several.  \n\n\nMore than that, I didn't want to be sent to the fuckin mental ward again. I hadn't been to one in years, and I had hoped I'd never have to go back. I finally decided I would wait it out until the next morning and then try eating again. After all, it was probably just been a hallucination. I mean, that makes more sense than the alternative. My grasp on the reality I'd always known was crumbling, and it was easier to think it was just a malfunction in my brain. Even though that was still concerning as hell.  \n\n\nI barely slept that night. I went outside for cigarette after cigarette, tip toeing on the creaky floors to avoid waking our roommates. My stomach felt like it was trying to eat itself, the growls and rumbles now seeming almost animalistic. I chugged some water. Opened the fridge. Rummaged through, hoping something would seem appealing. Nothing did. Everything looked like that damn eyeball. Chugged some more water, which I ended up being unable to keep down. Luckily no mysterious solids came up with it. I finally managed to doze off for an hour or two before my husband's alarm went off. I laid in bed until he left for work, then went out for yet another smoke.  \n\n\nIt was early, and I wanted to sleep more, but I was feeling more physically empty than I'd ever felt. I decided maybe it would be best to try an Ensure. If anyone is wondering, Ensure is the bane of my existence. I keep some on stock at all times to avoid being hospitalized, but damn if I don't fuckin hate those things. They remind me of every treatment center ever, those lovely little meal replacements for when we refuse solid food. You'd think that would deter me from refusing, but no. Let's just say I've had a LOT of Ensure in my 32 years of life.  \n\n\nSuffice to say, I felt like vomiting an eyeball was emergent enough to warrant a bottle of the caloric vanilla-flavored grossness. I chugged and choked it down, gagging but managing to finish it all. Yet again, I couldn't hold it down. And this time, when I vomited, up came what I can only assume was a piece of a tongue. It was just a thin strip, split at one end like a snake and uneven on the other end, appearing as if it had been torn off. It looked almost like it was starting to decay. It was a sickly grey, and it slid out of my throat and gagged me on it's way out. I studied it for a moment, willing myself to reach out and feel if it was really there. I pulled out a glove from my medicine cabinet and picked it up.  \n\n\nIf I was hallucinating, I definitely picked up something solid at the very least. I had never struggled with any kind of hallucinations, but I was almost hoping that's what was going on. Still, I could've been holding a piece of fuckin beef jerky thinking it was a tongue for all I really knew. It was definitely one of my only safe foods. The thought made me feel incredibly foolish and mortified at my disgusting act, and I tossed the piece back into the toilet and quickly flushed it.  \n\n\nI decided to poke around in the medicine cabinet for a remedy to my hunger induced insomnia, and found some old antipsychotic sedatives from several years back. I remember I had stopped taking them after only a week because they made me feel like a zombie. I also remembered snorting them once (like the idiot junkie I was at the time) and passing out shortly after. Given my current predicament with involuntary vomiting, I decided to go that route.. I already felt like a zombie anyway, and I just wanted to pass out. It felt strange to do that again, after 3 years clean. It stung my nasal cavity and made my eyes water, and I nearly gagged from the drip. But I swallowed and closed my eyes, took several deep breaths, and held it down.  \n\n\nAfter about 15 minutes of mindlessly scrolling through reddit in an attempt to distract myself, I felt my eyes starting to get heavy.  I fell asleep holding my phone, and didn't wake until later that evening sometime after my husband, Travis, came home from work. He woke me by kissing me gently, saying that I should wake up so I'd be able to fall asleep that night. He assumed I took a nap. I checked my phone, still in my hand, and saw that I'd been sleeping for well over 8 hours.  \n\n\nTypically I'd be concerned and disappointed that I'd wasted my day off work, but instead I was grateful. My stomach grumbled and growled, and a deep pain had begun to radiate from within the empty pit. Travis noticed my audible hunger and told me dinner was ready, then left me to get dressed. I pulled on a sweatshirt and some leggings and hobbled into the kitchen. I passed by a mirror in the hall on my way, and winced as I caught a glimpse of my haggard reflection. I looked worse than I had in years, even in my worst of my eating disorder. I felt more pain blossoming in my belly as familiar feelings of anxiety and dread crept in. This was bad. Very bad. I couldn't handle the thought of possibly needing to be hospitalized again. I wanted desperately to force down a meal, yet felt terrified that it would come up again.  \n\n\nWhen I sat down at the table, Travis looked at me with concern and asked if I was feeling alright. It was dark in our room when he woke me, so he hadn't really seen my face. I answered with complete honesty that I wasn't feeling well, and was very hungry but worried I might throw it up. He was reassuring, supportive; he sat closer to me and held me while I took a few bites. Finally the food looked like food, and my appetite came back for a moment. It was something he'd done through some of my worst moments, something that had gotten me through many unwanted meals. He would walk me to our bed and comfort me while I cried in pain from the overwhelming feeling of fullness, and he would lay there and hold me until I finally fell asleep.  \n\n\nThat day was no different, and I had nearly fallen asleep again after some time in his arms. The pain in my stomach had mostly gone, and I felt my eyes getting heavy once more. I felt a deep sense of relief at having kept down at least a little food, and I began to drift off.  \n\n\nI was jolted awake with a sudden, intense pang of nausea, and I barely made it to the bathroom before I projectile vomited in the general direction of the toilet.  \n\n\nThis time, some kind of tendril came up. Something that wasn't humanoid in any way, shape, or form. And this time, I wasn't the only one who saw it. Travis had run after me to help hold my hair back, and he freaked out as soon as he saw it hit the shallow bowl of water.  \n\n\n\"What the fuck? What is that? Babe, are you ok?\" He ran and embraced me as my vision blurred. I turned and looked at him with a combination of relief and fear; what I had seen was real. Slowly darkness seeped into my vision; I wobbled a bit then lost consciousness.  \n\n\nI awoke in the hospital 2 days later. As it turns out, I had esophageal varices and a severe sodium and potassium deficiency. Basically, my esophagus had some swollen veins that were bursting and bleeding into my stomach. Purging reaks havoc on the esophagus. And apparently, all the water I'd been chugging then puking had caused me to become dangerously low on sodium and potassium. The thing that Travis saw in the toilet was actually old blood, which can look like coffee grounds and/or have clots in it. I can only assume that whatever I saw and touched before was the same thing. I try not to think about it.  \n\n\nWhile I know now that I didn't physically vomit bits of monster, I still believe that I have a monster inside me. Me listening to it is what caused this whole thing. I've noticed however, over the last few years, that it's gotten more and more quiet. I hear it sometimes, whispering about how much I loved it, how I must miss it. How easy it would be to fall back in and sink again, into the cool, dark comfort of the pit.  \n\n\nThen I think of how close I was to death, how satisfied the monster was that I was fully willing to fade away. It wasn't easy, it was fucking hard. It was exhausting and empty and dreadful. So I keep moving forward. I continue to go forward and believe that I can keep the monster at bay.  \n\n\nAnd you can, too.,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/v5628f/theres_still_a_monster_inside_of_me/,False"

"TwoXChromosomes,peachymoo2,Uncomfortable with advice from a doctor,Hey, I\u2019m 22 and i\u2019ve been having some symptoms that are a little concerning and I was just wondering if anyone has experienced something like this. \n\nSex is really, really painful. I\u2019ve learned to bear it but it\u2019s never enjoyable, and sometimes I bleed after too. My periods are sooo painful, sometimes i throw up. It doesn\u2019t feel normal, but i don\u2019t know. I know i should ask a gyno, but unfortunately I live in a rural area with a shortage of doctors and it\u2019s impossible. I have an appointment, but wait times to see one are about a year and a half if i\u2019m lucky. \n\nI seen a clinic doctor recently, and they suggested I get drunk and try to have sex with my partner, and said that\u2019s all they can suggest if my STD test came back negative. I know they suggested it because of nerves, but he\u2019s my partner of 2 years and I\u2019m definitely not nervous during sex, and it made me feel a little uncomfortable, like I wasn\u2019t taken seriously. I\u2019m feeling anxious that it\u2019s a serious issue that I won\u2019t be able to talk about for a long time with a gyno, has anyone else experienced these symptoms maybe, or have any advice?,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/v56156/uncomfortable_with_advice_from_a_doctor/,False"

"TwoXChromosomes,MisogynyisaDisease,If a school district attempt to/succeeds in banning a book from curriculum or libraries, we should make it our duty to procure the books ourselves. Especially for the sake of our daughters.,Maus, while being a detailed tale about the events of the Holocaust, also talks about post partum depression, class based misogyny, \"jew free towns\" in poland that are eerily similar to the \"lgbt free towns\" now in Poland, and several other important signs of violence against vulnerable communities.\n\nThe Bluest Eye talks about racism, CSA, male privilege, rape culture, and miscarriage\n\nSpeak talks about sexual assault while heavily inebriated, rape culture, not being believed, and depression\n\nGender Queer talks about the journey of self identification, asexuality, gender roles, what it looks like to be a child struggling when gender identity, and being comfortable in your own body even when it comes to a haircut or shaving your legs\n\n\nThese banned books are so important. Taking them out of the reach of even college bound teenagers is doing them a disservice. I can say without a shadow of a doubt that Speak is what lead me to finally accept that I was assaulted when I was an 8th grader, and I still have the copy my teacher gave me, and even before I accepted that it helped me understand that I was showing serious symptoms of depression.

"TwoXChromosomes,wittlewolfie,Working as a nurse has made me hate men,Disclaimer: NOT ALL MEN! That being said, it\u2019s FAR TOO MANY MEN!! \n\nI graduated from nursing school last year and have been working in a nursing facility ever since. The amount of sexual harassment I receive is astounding. \n\nI experienced sexual harassment before I became a nurse, and even sexual assault, but I didn\u2019t let those relatively rare occurrences ruin my opinion of men. Ever since getting this job, however, I\u2019ve become very wary of all men and have grown to be disgusted by male sexuality and men in general. \n\nI have patients making nasty comments towards me on a regular basis. I\u2019ve had patients offer me money in exchange for sexual services. I had one patient pull his dick out and ask me to give him a blowjob. I had one patient who tried to pull me into his bed. I had one patient who pulled me onto his lap and put his hands on my waist and said \u201cI can\u2019t get over your curves\u201d. And these are just a few examples.\n\nI also have far too many patients who flirt with me and ask me out. Although not as bad, this is still annoying and highly inappropriate. I am a medical professional and want to be treated as such. A medical facility is not a place to get dates, nor is it morally right for a patient to try to get their nurse to violate the nurse-patient relationship. \n\nBy the way, not all of these patients are old and demented. Many of them are on the younger side (40s, 50s, 60s) and are here receiving rehabilitative care following hospitalization. They are fully alert and oriented and have the mental capacity to know their behavior is wrong yet they still choose to behave poorly. \n\nWhy is it so difficult for men NOT to sexualize women? Why is it so difficult for men to treat women professionally?

That the trial empowered him to speak up because now people know women can be abusers.\n\nHe spoke about our breakup years ago. He mentioned that I cheated, verbally assaulted him, threatened suicide, and sexually assaulted him.\n\nI did none of these things. He knows I did none of these things. I'm so afraid this is going to hurt my partner or myself. Him and my current partner work in the same field. But if I do anything about it he'll see it as another awful slight against him and come after me. He still harasses a girl who rejected him in high school.\n\nI'm also so afraid that maybe I did assault him. He was in love with someone else during our relationship for months before I found out. In that time he cut off all affection. Everytime I asked if something was happening he would tell me I was crazy. I was imagining things. I needed therapy. One night I got all dressed up in new lingerie and surprised him when he got home. He refused me and I cried. I begged him to just give me a chance. I thought I could fix things with sex. I know now how wrong that was but he gave in and we slept together.  He had pressured me into sexual things I was uncomfortable with before but I don't know if this was worse.\n\nI don't know if he's making the other things up or if he genuinely believes them. I never even spoke to another man when we were together except for when I was with him. I was working 3 jobs at points. And I did say I would commit suicide, but not if we broke up. I said I would do it if I had to move back home with my parents. \n\nI'm scared. My partner and friends keep assuring me nothing will happen. That no one believes him. But I've been raped and I don't want anyone to see me how I see the men who assaulted me.\n\nSorry this is so long and rambling.,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/v4ie9t/my_ex_is_using_the_depp_vs_heard_case_to_accuse/,False"

I need help.,ill be honest, its 12:30 am rn, I have a 13 hour shift tomorrow and should be asleep but tonight was the night i finally snapped and have no clue what to do or how yo go about this. Im a 21 y o(M). everything seems like its going good from anyone else\u2019s point of view: im marrying the girl of my dreams next year, im s home owner (its a fixer upper but its home) I have a car im building to be a show car. Im going paycheck to paycheck right now which isnt a problem im content. Or Atleast i thought i was. I have too much emotional trauma that ive built up due to never having anyone or any way to express my feelings. My escape was video games and cars but now they dont seem to affect me at all. It seems more like a chore to me to keep me going than to actually have fun with it. I texted my best friends and thanked them and told them how grateful i am to have them bc they e truly helped me out more than they know. The truth is, a minimum of once a week ive had vivid imagery of unaliving myself. To the point I genuinely sit and think \u201cam I really going to do it this time?\u201d The only thing thats holding me back is the fact ive impacted alot of lives in my city and i have alot of people looking up to me as some type of role model. Even though i dont necessarily get it. Those people, my best friends, and my family are the only things keeping me here because i dont want to cause them any more harm than what\u2019s already going on. My dad just had a divorce with my step mom of 13 years, bc she had a midlife crisis and cheated on him. I genuinely think hes also had suicidal thoughts and he comes to me to vent to help him. do you have any idea how crushed hed be if he heard i painted my walls with the pistol he bought me for house protection?  These are the thoughts that are running through my head right now. And im laying here next to my sleeping fiance crying typing all of this but it feels good to let it out. My mental state is failing, i feel as if id feel better if i wasnt on this earth anymore and itd make everyone around me have an easier life. Im struggling to keep my composure and i have no clue how much longer i can keep up the act that im totally okay and im the always smiling dude who helps everyone in sight act up. But honestly inside i dont feel much of anything. I feel empty and that im a failure. At this point im rambling because typing is the only thing saving me right now. Thank you for reading this and listening to me vent my feelings. Even though i dont know who you all are you have also helped me get through one more night, or Atleast i hope i dont break later on.

I say I feel stupid for it because I only did it to release my frustrations towards my wife.   \nPriest: And now you're just as frustrated and short $300?   \nMan: Father, I don't know what you mean????   \nPriest: For the lap dance!   \nMan: It costed $100, it was what they call VIP.   \nPriest: So what would $300 get me?   \nMan: Father, I don't know...food?   \nPriest: All you can eat tacos?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/v5684s/true_confessional_story/,True"

"atheism,Forseen-Surprise,How do I talk with a very closely religious family,I love my parents and am mostly open with them. They are good people.\n\nOftentimes the topic of religion is brought up and I have to give my (generalized) side of: Humanity has always feared what they don\u2019t understand and constantly through history we see religions constantly come up and change. Current religions reflect our current values and cultures. They grow to be very rigid and complicated with rules and ideas but they all fall short on the need for blind faith.\n\nBut they always bring up their personal experiences with faith, which I can\u2019t argue against without being a complete asshole. Both members have had personal visions. My mom was bleeding and almost miscarried me but an angel appeared to her and it stopped. She has spoken to a family member from heaven in a dream. My dad has had two major family deaths which deeply affected him as a person and has multiple times seen them in dreams.\n\nThey are otherwise normal people. I wouldn\u2019t call them Evangelical because their beliefs outside of personal religion are vastly different.\n\nI would otherwise let them believe but they keep forcing me into religious things I can\u2019t get out of, I am a minor.

"Jokes,robotsexpants666,Gef The Totally Normal Duck,  So, there's this duck. His name is Gef (Pronounced Jeff. The spelling actually comes from Gef's Welsh ancestors, who were widely known in the UK for being the finest net-makers in the land. Their nets were so legendary that kings and princes and lords bought the Wshlgrrrmanxxs family's nets for their great eel hunts. The eel hunt of 1473, better known as The Gravy Incident, is an especially fine tale that shows the elasticity and frankly astounding amount of tensile strength that the Wshlgrrrmanxxs's were capable of crafting into their nets. After this incident, all nets in the UK were required to meet the exacting standards of Mr. Wshlgrrmanxxs, who developed his net-weaving technique over decades spent braiding the hair of noble girls in many a public tavern. Mr. Wshlgrrmanxxs was known for his nets and his patented seventeen-strand Queen's Knot Braid, is the point of this aside.).\n\n  Gef is a regular looking duck. He has a white body, orange feet, and an orange beak. Except for this one little black spot on his left foot. Gef has always been self-conscious about that black spot, as he feels it makes him stand out too much from other ducks. Gef often goes out of his way to stand or sit in such a way that the tiny black birth mark is hidden from the view of other ducks. \n\n  Gef lives in a modest apartment, a handsome two bedroom with an open floor plan and hardwood floors throughout. Gef's girlfriend Blaire lives with him, she moved in about a year ago and things are getting rocky in the relationship as Gef feels she might be using him for his money. Gef's mother died five years back and left him a sizeable inheritance which he has in turn invested wisely and Gef is currently living comfortably off of the interest in his trading accounts.\n\n  So one day Gef goes into Best Buy and he's just kinda walking around, checking out the new release Blu-Rays. Gef is really into Bulgarian arthouse films. It's a fascinating genre whose films mostly consist of long, lingering shots of women's knees as they sit on a bus. The runtime of the most popular examples of Bulgarian arthouse cinema often top six hours. It's a challenging genre that requires true dedication and love of the cinematic arts. Gef is a bit of a cinephile, is the point, I guess.\n\n  Gef's walking around and he sees an employee with a nametag that reads : Jim. Gef walks up to Jim and awkwardly shuffles around, trying not to present the black spot on his left foot to Jim. Jim finally looks down and notices this rather ordinary looking duck with the white body and orange feet and orange beak standing there.\n\n  \"Can I help you?\"\n\nGef looks up and cocks his head to one side before answering, \"Got any grapes?\"\n\n  Jim looks confused for a few moments, begins to answer one thing, stops, and finally goes with the simplest answer he can think of, \"Uh, dude, this is a Best Buy, we don't have grapes. Sorry?\"\n\n  Gef just nods his head, as ducks do, and says, \"Cool cool. Thanks, anyway.\" and turns around to go look for Der Schulringerzingers's Knees IV : Glorpinschotpper's Revenge. He already had a copy of the award-winning film on DVD, but what he really wanted was a Blu-Ray copy with the 8 minutes of additional footage added by the director. Gef had already checked Amazon, and it was sold out everywhere, so he figured Best Buy would be the most logical next place to find a very well-known Bulgarian arthouse film.\n\n  After not finding his film, Gef decided to head home. Blaire was mad because she didn't believe Gef that the store was out of grapes. Gef just wanted to drink a pale ale and read his great-grandfather's memoir a little bit before heading to bed. Gef's favorite pale ale is this really smooth micro-brew called Schlammin Salmon. Schlammin Salmon is brewed and bottled in Kiev, Wisconsin by a group of Quakers that rejected traditional Quaker life as being \"too wild\". Great group of guys.\n\n  So a couple of days later, Gef's back at Best Buy, hoping to find Der Schulringerzingers's Knees IV : Glorpinschotpper's Revenge, even if it's just a regular Blu-Ray without the extra 8 minutes of footage added by the director. \n\n  Gef sees Jim and heads that way. Jim looks down as Gef shuffles around, hiding the tiny black spot on his otherwise gloriously flawless orange foot.\n\n  \"Hey, you're that duck from the other day, right?\"\n\n  \"Yeah, man. Thanks for remembering me.\"\n\n  \"Anything I can help you with?\"\n\nGef shuffles his (mostly) orange feet, \"Got any grapes?\"\n\n  Jim was a little annoyed at this weird duck with the flawless orange feet that kept coming into HIS place of employment and harassing him about grapes. Jim had been deathly afraid of grapes since he was four years old and what his mom calls \"The Fruit That Shall Not Be Named Incident of 1984\". The Incident began a 27-year long crusade by Jim to avoid being around the fearsome fruit. So he was more than a little annoyed as he answered, \"Listen, man, I already told you we don't have grapes here. I'm getting a little tired of you coming in here and harassing me. If you come back here one more time asking about grapes, I'm gonna staple your beak shut!\"\n\n  Gef shuffled back a few steps, making sure to keep the black spot out of sight, \"Alright, alright, no problem, man. You don't have grapes, I get it.\" Gef shakes his head in that way ducks do and walks out of Best Buy, grapeless.\n\n  Gef got home and Blaire yelled at him some more about the grapes. Gef put on a film and fell asleep to the shockingly bold camera angles and masterful lighting techniques of famed Bulgarian auteur Terrniglobingham. Terrniglobingham's films were often described by even fans of the genre as \"challenging\", with their well over 8 hour runtimes and unmoving shots of decaying dogs on hot freshly poured blacktop.\n\n  So a few days go by and Gef finds himself back in Best Buy. He sees Jim and waddles over, shuffling about as he stops to hide his left foot behind his right. Jim looks down and sees the perfectly ordinary duck with the flawless orange feet and he's kinda happy to see Gef, since Jim has been having problems with his aging mother who is in the early stages of dementia and isn't able to properly care for herself any more. Jim looks down at this gorgeous little duck with the flawless orange webbed feet and he smiles just a little, like people do, and Jim says, \"Hey man, good to see you again. What can I help you with?\"\n\n  Gef glances down quickly to make sure his tiny black birthmark is hidden from Jim's view, then looks up to meet Jim's grey-eyed gaze. The grey eyes were a fascinating genetic leftover sort-of-hand-me-down type situation. See, Jim's great-grandfather, Colonel Richard Tipp, of the North Carolina Tipps (NOT the South Carolina Tipps, which were mountain men of some fearsome regard. The South Carolina Tipps were known to set bear traps along popular trade routes, picking through their crop of entrapped travellers to find the most likely wives), was of Transylvanian descent; Transylvanians, of course, are known for having the extremely rare DDNC420 gene that when expressed gives the clear grey eye color that I've been trying to describe to you for a while now.\n\n  Gef says, \"Got any staples?\"\n\nJim is relieved the question wasn't about the Fruit That Shall Not Be Named, \"I think we might by the printers and stuff. Stay right here, I'll go take a look.\"\n\n  Jim heads off to find the staples and Gef contents himself with looking at a DVD copy of Herr Blumingsclongers ode to dislocated kneecaps Scpliegeneneneneflaurburg's Flowers, which was shot in 1972 by a half-blind Dutchman who had immigrated to Bulgaria during the second world war to escape persecution in his home country by a group of rival filmmakers who had decided that knees were not an aesthetically pleasing enough body part for study on film, instead demanding that shins become the new genre standard.\n\n  Jim comes back in a couple of minutes and stops in front of Gef, who shuffles around a bit to hide the tiny black mark on his otherwise flawless orange webbed foot.\n\n  \"Sorry, man, we are completely out of staples.\"\n\n  Gef nods in that way that ducks do and cocks his head to one side, \"Got any grapes?\",https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/v56dz9/gef_the_totally_normal_duck/,False"

"movies,Inevitable_Working55,Thank You To This Community,Hi Guys,\n\nI just wanted to thank this community for so many good recommendations. From the mainstream to the way out there, this sub has renewed my love of movies. I would have never known about \"Mandy\" or a lot of other Cage's best/craziest work were it not for this sub. I've found so many awesome horror movies from this sub and some nice quiet slice of life movies as well. \n\nMy recommendation for a movie I don't think a lot of people have seen: Ulee's Gold. One of Peter Fonda's best roles. \n\nI was in college in the 90's and I love 90's and 70's cinema. I thought all that was lost to the comic movies (I enjoy a good DC or Marvel movie, I'm no snob, but I miss variety at the box office). Anyway, you all have introduced me to some great older movies I can't believe I haven't seen and some wonderful newer releases as well that I just missed.\n\nThanks movie friends!,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/v56gi9/thank_you_to_this_community/,False"

"tifu,MuskyLion,TIFU be telling my fiancee she was using me,Obligatory caveat: this took place in 2005.\n\nMy fiancee, Lauren (F20) and I (M26) took a trip to Cape Cod, MA for a few days of fun and ocean viewing. This was not an excursion to some million dollar mansion, mind you, just a couple days at B&Bs and enjoying sights along the way.\n\nOne night we stopped at a quaint little place and spent the night. It started out great. We made love and enjoyed each other in the way 20-somethings enjoy life. Lauren was beautiful, quirky, and I was totally addicted to her. After a long day of travel, sex re-energized me with my 26-YO libido, but it understandably wore her out. I wanted to continue; she did not. \n\nMy FU: I got pouty and whiny (such that my baritone voice can actually whine) and was a total AH about her need for rest. I didn't try to force her to continue, TFG I wasn't that big of an AH, but I did the next worst thing and told her that it felt like she used me to achieve her needs but wasn't reciprocative when it came to mine. This was total BS on my part and I knew it almost immediately.\n\nShe didn't get mad. What happened was infinitely worse. Her. Silence. Was. Deafening! She told me she needed to go outside to think. I could already tell I had committed a major FU. I let her have her space. After 5 minutes I stepped outside, but she was nowhere to be seen. I was terrified that she just walked away hundreds of miles from home. She came back after 30 minutes and I could tell I had pushed her away.\n\nI tried to make amends and bent over backwards to make things right, but I only ended pushing her away further and faster. Two weeks later she went out of state and NC to be away from me for a week. When she got back, we talked. She told me I was right that she was using me, specifically as rebound from a previous lover; she wasn't, but I knew it was over. She asked me if I wanted the ring back; I said to keep it because I didn't want it as a reminder. And just like that, it was over.\n\nI deserved what I got (and I probably deserved a lot worse) and wasn't able to open up as intimately again with another woman. She forgave me long ago. I have only been able to forgive myself in the last few years. It was a long road back to this point and the lessons learned were legion, but I'm hopeful for the future again. \n\nTL;DR: I threw a tantrum, told my fiancee she was using me, and incepted that idea deep in her mind years before the movie Inception existed.,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/v56krp/tifu_be_telling_my_fiancee_she_was_using_me/,False"

Maybe both?\n\nSorry, English is my third language. I'm with my husband 11 years already, never parted a single day. So we not newlywed or anything, but he just so patience with me.\n\nExample, I tend to nag alot, and I know men hate that. But it doesn't faze him a bit. All these years with him, whenever I nag him, never once he gets mad. He sit and listened to me nag, then kissed me on the lips, then I nag again, he continued listen, then he kissed me on the lips again. *He said: I can nag all I want till I'm satisfy, and he will listen to it all, but he will kisses me in between,* lol. He just so good at diffuse.\n\nAnd another, I can have temper, and when I have anger outburst, I slam stuff. Example, last time we were in the kitchen, nearest to me was the kitchen dinner table, I slam everything on that table down the floor. Tea, sodas spill all over floor. And we had a big bowl of fresh cherries, so it rolled all over the kitchen floor too.\n\nHe not even mad. He just quietly kneel down on his knee, and used his hands to pick up every cherries and everything that I slammed down from the table, and clean all the spills. Washed all the cherries and put it back on the table.\n\nWell, I slammed the big bowl of cherries down again. So twice. He still not mad, he quietly kneel down and pick up all the cherries rolling all over the floor, and put it back on the table again. *He said: \"I can slam it 20 times and he will pick it up 20 times again, he said I can do it as many times until I'm Satisfy\".*\n\nAt that time I was in tears (I feel terrible). He that MUCH patience. Maybe it love, maybe he smitten with me. I basically gave up, after that, I never slam anything again. He basically diffuse, and calm my outburst (using his eccentric ways).\n\nAnd his odd/eccentric quirk with me. He literally, yes, literally kisses my butt cheek (random affection, nothing related to sex at all), and this has going on for as long as we married.\n\nWhenever we in bed together, whenever he see me lay on my stomach play on my tablet/phone, I could be wearing shorts/pants or even if I have a blanket over my butt, he would gently slide down the blanket and pants and kissed my butt cheek, and slide it back on for me. It like he went out of his ways.\n\nNo, he Never was the type that like those slap, gropes, spank stuff. He very respectful, he said he prefers use his lips and mouth. So he just simply put his lips on my butt cheek and gently kiss it, the gentle slow kiss type.\n\nHe just so odd, like he has his own ways of doing things, lol. Not complaining, just wonder is this like patience + smitten at the same time? lol (even after 11 years with each other everyday).\n\nwell, I'm into astrology so I guess I can use astrology to explain him by his birth chart, but since this is not an astrology sub. I admit to I have a short temper, I have stop slam things when I'm mad. But the nagging is still there, I need to work on my nagging.,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/v56n6n/is_my_husband_just_so_patience_with_me_or_he_just/,False"

"personalfinance,Diamondcheck123,Should I request a pay raise 8 months into the job?,I am new to the industry of EHS. I have worked for my current company for 8 months now. My job description included working in environmental and safety roles. A couple of months ago,  we had a mass layoff and I was given a large amount of tasks from an individual who got laid off. \n\nThe task I received was environmental compliance of our products (among others). This was not in the description. I had taken on this role and realized that half the work my predecessor was doing was bogus (making fake environmental complaince reports) and there was no program of environmental compliance  within the company. I set up the program and have vastly improved the way our company responds to environmental compliance requests.  \n\nHere's the kicker. This extra tasks takes an enormous percentage of my time. I would say about 30-50%. Which is why I have slowed down on completing my work as an EHS personnel. My boss is considering handing off the environmental compliance duties to another department so I can focus on my primary role. \n\nI really like this work, especially cause I built it from the ground up. I wouldn't want someone else to reap the benefits of my hard work of setting this all up. I don't want to give away this duty. Instead I want to keep it, keep my EHS duties, and increase my hours by about 8-15 per week (I am salaried, so no OT). In return, I'd like to ask for a raise of $20,000. Here's how I broke down this number. \n\nI get paid $40/hour. I expect to work an average of 10 hours extra per week. That's $400 per week (not counting OT rate), and about $20k per year. \n\nAm I justified in asking for this raise? Will it be taken seriously or would I be laughed out of the room? Any advice on how to approach this will be appreciated.,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/v56t76/should_i_request_a_pay_raise_8_months_into_the_job/,False"

Not that it was anything bad, I actually really liked that they used that idea being someone that is a huge fan of star wars to incorporate that stunt with fighter jets actually made me appreciate the movie more because the similarities.

"atheism,MansaMusaGang,Anyone Else Have Pro-Life Family Members That Fail to See the Irony of Using the Bible to Support Their Stance?,I wanted to take the opportunity to use this community to vent about an argument I had with my family members. My family consists of African-Americans who are all by and large firmly religious or at least pay lip service to religion. It's pretty ubiquitous and understandably so since most of my family were born and raised in or lived in the southern United States. The idea that anyone African-American would not be convinced of the existence of a god/their god makes my family members incredulous. Read below if you are interested. Otherwise, ***TL;DR***: **The Bible paints a picture of God as someone who is a petty, chauvinistic, megalomaniacal manchild who would gladly snuff out the lives of the unborn and infants if it meant he could bask in the glory of torturing or killing humans that committed a finite offense rather than the pro-lifer evangelical Christians would like everyone to believe.**\n\nLike many African-American communities my family credits its survival, struggles, and triumphs to a god they can't even provide veritable proof of existing. Even more dubious is their claim that said god was responsible for helping African-Americans gain freedom from slavery and how said god is helping African-Americans gain equal footing in America. It's a bit jarring to me and they fail to see the irony of the situation for both enslaved Blacks and their slaveowners (spoiler warning - they both believed by choice, compulsion, or existence in the same god but somehow came to two different conclusions concerning human rights). \n\nToday's family conversation was about abortion. On a driveway full of adults who had all had children. And I happened to walk in on the conversation. *Ooooh, I knew this was not going to be smooth*. I'm coming outside and my second oldest sibling locks eyes with me and calls me over for my opinion. I'm already donning my mental riot gear knowing that I will have five adults screeching at me, mentally assaulting me, and dismissing my points on the merit of \"tHaT's MaN's wIsDoM\" (can explain that fallacy more if anyone would like). What inspired this was probably the leaked Supreme Court decision to subvert the prior decision on *Roe v Wade*. I knew the instant I said that I was pro-choice instead of pro-life I had invited trouble. Cue such classic cliches such as:\n\n\"Wow, you think it's okay for someone to kill their baby because they messed around?\"\n\n\"You know the Black community should be so much stronger and larger. Our number one killer isn't heart disease, diabetes, gun violence, or even police brutality but instead abortions..(insert ramble on stats here)\"\n\n\"What if Mary chose to abort Jesus? Where would that leave my soul and your soul?\" *(Always annoying since my family knows I am an agnostic atheist and they are convinced enough persistent references to Jesus will bring me back to the faith because \"his love knows no bounds\")* \n\nIt always baffles me how evangelical Christians claim that God (Yahweh/Jesus) is so pro-life and against any forms of miscarriages, abortions, or infanticide. I used some but not all of these Scriptures as counterpoints to their emotional appeals and attempts to attack my character. Accordingly to the Bible...\n\n**God on Abortion, Miscarriages, and Forced Sterilization**\n\n* God had no problem doing a factory reset several times to several city-nations and areas that he was pissed with. The most notorious example of this is when God gets upset with mankind for being so duplicitous that instead of reasoning with people who supposedly are made in his image he drowns everyone save eight people. The flood is said to have not only killed people but among those killed were probably pregnant women. Whether local or global, there is still a probability that a pregnant woman died and in the process a developing fetus was aborted. (Genesis 6-9)\n*  *\u201cWhen men strive together, and hurt a woman with child, so that  there is a miscarriage, and yet no harm follows, the one who hurt her  shall be fined, according as the woman\u2019s husband shall lay upon; and he  shall pay as the judges determine. \u00a0If any harm follows, then you shall  give life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth\u2026\u201c (*Exodus 21:22-24) God is more concerned about the woman's livelihood - there are no consequences equivalent to the death penalty as is for other sins in the Old Testament. This implies that the death penalty does not get issued as a punishment because the fetus is not considered to be a sentient agent until birth.  The miscarried fetus is essentially treated like a wrecked car or misplaced DVD player that needs to be paid for through court judgment. \n* Moses claims authoritatively that God speaks to him and through him, and God created this  bizarre ritual that can be performed on a wife SUSPECTED of adultery by her husband. The ritual not only shames the woman publicly but if the woman is found guilty of adultery she is not only forced to miscarry the child of another man but will also become sterile/experience rotting of her womb and body. ( Numbers 5:11-21 ) Pretty sure she/partner if their identity became known would both be stoned to death after as well.\n* After Israel started worshiping other deities and an Israelite man got some hanky-panky from the Midianite women in Numbers 25 and was killed for it, Moses gets a command from God to take revenge on them via arson, slaughtering every possible male they came across, slaughtering all of the boys post-woman abduction, and every woman who has have ever slept with a woman. This implies if a woman was visibly pregnant she would have been slaughtered - this would clearly be an abortion of the fetus. ( Numbers 31:17 )\n* God permitted Hosea to pray for the tribe of Ephraim in Israel to no longer have children and God granted that request - meaning every woman who was pregnant miscarried and those that weren't were now sterile. ( Hosea 9:11-16 )\n* God makes promises to and according to the Bible delivers upon those same promises to allow pregnant women to be ripped open. Clearly not only would that be an abortion but it is also savage, bloodthirsty, and sadistic behavior by a god that Christians claim is loving. ( Hosea 13:16 ,  2 Kings 15:16 , etc.)\n\n**God on Infanticide**\n\n* God will have a history of allowing infants and toddlers to be collateral damage in whatever holy war he launches against other nations or the people he favors like a homicidal racist. God commands Saul to \" destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass.\" (1 Samuel 15:1-4).\n* God will punish both foreign nations and his own sinful nation in his own \"just\" way - by letting infants get dashed against rocks (2 Kings 8:12,  Psalms 135:8 & 136:10), let his own nation's infants get slaughtered (Ezekiel 9:6), and let starving women consume their own children out of desperation ( Lamentations 2:20)\n\n**God on Child Murderin'**\n\n* God really wanted to establish how firm Abraham's trust in him as deity over the latter's life. God commands Abraham to build an altar to bind and kill his son Isaac his son upon with a knife. God Punk'd Abraham to see if he was ballsy enough to consider killing his own offspring who should have been more precious to him than an ritual. ( Genesis 22:9 -10 )\n* An unruly or disobedient child could get stoned to death at the discretion of the parents for being disrespectful -  *\u201cFor every one that curseth his father or his mother  shall be surely put to death: he hath cursed his father or his mother;  his blood shall be upon him.\u201d*  (Leviticus 20:9) Don't like that your five year old is smack-talking you because they don't want to eat their veggies? Just take em into the community and get them stoned to death. \n* Jephthah gets a little too pious and cocky and promises that he will sacrifice the very first thing that comes out to greet him as he comes home from a battle on the field. No idea why this dumbass made that promise - after all, wouldn't his daughter be the first to greet him? And before we get the special cases of pleading, Jephthah specifically said sacrifice as in a burnt offering. God didn't challenge his oath and he also didn't promise an alternative sacrifice on her behalf (i.e. becoming a celibate servant in the temple). ( Judges 11:30-40 )\n\n***I could post Scripture after Scripture here but the point is that any appeals to the Bible as an inerrant, divinely-inspired, and inspirational history of a loving, benevolent god that is pro-life is gravely inaccurate. It's actually much safer to say that God would kill your family and any unborn children through war, plague, or natural disasters just because someone violated one of his arbitrary rules that his modern followers didn't even read or know about, God would permit women to have miscarriages based on infidelity or some crackpot prophet making a request, and that God would actually convince you to kill your own children.***\n\nBut, the sad part is that even as I could see that what I was saying was starting to form cracks in the foundations of their religious arguments they would quickly double down. I essentially wasted my breath. After the end of the debate I got the passive aggressive statements of, \"I will be praying for you!\" , \"We all still love you!\", \"Maybe God can speak to your heart on this!\" lobbed at me. I honestly felt like I was getting them to recognize that the Bible is not the pro-life message they think it is (let alone true) but instead details one of the most bloodthirsty and inconceivable beings to ever live.\n\nIt drove me nuts.I don't think I can ever involve myself in any other discussion with them about the character of the deity they believe in if they will simply rationalize in their heads that what the Bible says is always true, always loving, and always applicable to everyone at every moment in time.,https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/v570hw/anyone_else_have_prolife_family_members_that_fail/,False"

It was really annoying and weird considering nobody had called HOA yet. so they installed a new basketball hoop at about 1 am during one of their parties. I live in an upstairs room with a window facing  the hoops which are on the driveway. They were playing and it woke me up so I went to the window and looked at them as they looked at my window.

Basically I\u2019ve budgeted and planned out my move from Texas to Minnesota in July completely, and initially had the funds to do so in my savings, but my car recently got totaled and I lost half of what I had saved to fix it.\n\nNow I\u2019m stuck needing $5000, but have no idea how to get it outside of a personal loan. However as my title says I have little to no credit history, I\u2019m 22 and just got my first credit card. My credit score is at 685, and my gross income is $20000 at my current job. When I move I\u2019ll have a better paying job, but unfortunately I need to actually get there first.\n\nStaying isn\u2019t an option as I have no place to stay after July ends and my job transfer has already been set up for the beginning of August. So, I\u2019ve resorted to looking at loaners like Sofi and Prosper that have no minimum wage requirement. \n\nAre there better options for personal loans besides these companies that will consider me? Are they really trustworthy or will they screw me over with different APR rates after they run my credit check?\n\nSorry if I sound inexperienced, I honestly feel completely out of my depth here.

Cool, which part specifically? \"They kill other Muslims\". Oh so then killing professing Muslims is why they aren't Muslim? What about killing apostates? \"Well Isis doesn't represent Islam.\" OK. So killing apostates is bad? \"Isis doesn't represent Islam\". I'm well aware of that sir, but what is the truth of the matter? \"media makes Islam look bad and misleads people\". Cool, sir its pretty easy to just clear things up. Just answer the question .\n\nNow, note that I do know that there are those who call themselves Muslim or christian and are pretty open about what they think their religion ought to be. But its just too bad that there are those that cannot point to specifics of what we poor atheists (whom most are ex theists anyways) got wrong because they won't condemn their fellows. \n\nTheists think atheists criticize Islam because of Isis are delusional. No. There is so many. Convince me why and how arresting someone for making fun of a prophet is in anyway something I should support. Were the Swedish riots representing Islam? No? Then who pray tell represents Islam? You seem to act like YOU represent Islam since you have the guts to say that Isis doesn't. Cool. Then tell me 'Islam does/doesn't support arresting apostates\"..\n\nTldr, if a theist claims that a group doesn't represent their religion, it should be easy to say which values the group got wrong.

"television,Teimy,Is \u2018Friday Night Lights\u2019 Season 1 The Most Underrated First Season In Television History?,Going into the show I had low expectations, I had seen it made fun of in parodies or talked about in a negative light. I can see why its easy to make fun of, from the outside it is a typical high school drama show with sports added to the mix, but once you actually watch it the show is way more than that. \n\nThe show does not focus on Football, but the stories within the team that makes the show what it is. It really is a 180 of expectation.\n\nFirst you have a commentary on life after sports for promising athletes, what happens to those who have put all their eggs into Football but ultimately are unsuccessful. How their lives are ruined because of poor planning and a lack of ambition to accomplish anything else in life. \n\nDisabilities and their effect on family, partners, community and the person themselves. \n\nWhat it means to be a man or what it is to be a noble person in general. \n\nThose with potential to accomplish big things but lack a mentor figure to give them self belief. \n\nDeception and lying to your family in pursuit of greatness. \n\nThis show honestly has everything and its a great watch. \n\nP.S Season 2 onwards the quality dips significantly, but still not a terrible watch.,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/v576p6/is_friday_night_lights_season_1_the_most/,False"

"LifeProTips,dercas79,LPT: Unnecessary High Beams,If you feel that your headlights are slightly dim and want to turn on your high beams, take 2 seconds and check the intensity of the lights for your instruments.  They should be just slightly dimmer than your normal headlights.\n\nI drive a truck and have people in the freeway pass me with their brights on many times throughout each night.  At least 90% of them have their instrument lights extremely bright.  This wrecks your night vision and causes your headlights to seem dimmer than they actually are.\n\nReducing the brightness in order to feel comfortable continuing to drive with only your low beams will reduce eye strain, driver fatigue and still allow you to see the road.\n\nThe only time I feel like I need my high beams on is out on country roads where there is a higher chance of encountering deer and other animals.  I never use them on the freeway unless it's to ask someone else to turn theirs off.\n\nIf you want to signal a trucker that it's safe for them to change lanes, the best method is to turn your headlights off and then back on again.  Flashing your high beams gets the message across, but it is blinding in our mirrors.\n\nPlease share this with as many people as you can for the sake of safety.  I continue to see many more people on the freeways each week driving along through traffic with their high beams on for some reason.,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/v57acn/lpt_unnecessary_high_beams/,False"

Chris 'Andy Dwyer' Pratt.\n\nObviously he's famous for *Parks and Rec* and *Guardians of the Galaxy* and some may find his goofy schtick a bit tiresome, but I have to say that the man has had small roles in some decent films over the past 14 years, including:\n\n* Wanted (2008)\n* Bride Wars (2009)\n* Jennifer's Body (2009)\n* Moneyball (2011)\n* The Five-Year Engagement (2012)\n* Zero Dark Thirty (2012)\n* Her (2013)\n* The Magnificent Seven (2016)\n* The Kid (2019)\n\nNow I'm not saying that all of the above were masterpieces, but it's interesting to go back and watch Chris as a working actor trying to make the most of these smaller roles, especially now he's more of a 'leading man'.

"movies,themightykobold,I enjoy the reoccurring realization that the Spy Kids movies and the Machete movies exist in the same universe. What are some other cool canon shared universes?, Pretty much what it says in the title. Machete was introduced as the Spy Kids uncle in the first movie and then was spun off into his own story by director Robert Rodriguez. My favorite scene in Spy Kids is when Danny Trejo busts through the window at the end and reminds them that Uncle Machete has got their backs. Later, Machete would be made into a fake trailer for the Grindhouse films, but it was so well received that they made a complete film for it.\n\nAre there other disparate films that exist in the same universe? Or which movie worlds would you like to see crossed over?\n\nOther ones that I can think of include the Alien movies and the Predator movies, and Ghostbusters and the Caspar the Friendly Ghost universe (Dan Ackroyd has a brief cameo in Caspar movie as they try to exorcize the house).\n\nThis discussion post apparently requires 300 words, so other words from a random word generator include:\n\nEffort, if, gate, row, sentence, formulate, pure, social, achievement, negative, door, econobox, genetic, boot, camera, bundle, solid, exemption, low, habitat, ear, permanent, pursuit, lot, warn, humor, seat, mountain, register, prestige, loose, expression, spider, mutter, install, kidney, stake, year, differ, matrix, title, detective, banner, investigation, silence, cousin, diagram, flourish, recession, unique, available, measure, idolize, obtainable, dip, encourage, ashamed, rail, spill, abashed, certain, number, refuse, snails, cook, medical, awake, value, unaccountable, form, advertisement, doubtful, nod, ablaze, probable, scan, frantic, smooth, crow, take, aberrant, absorb, feed, organic, shake, pleasure, digest, dirt, walk, tub, industry, fixed, rotten, goat, induce, ant, expand, utter, oatmeal, cord, imply, railway, likeable, flippant, hydrant, veil, determine, impinge, scientific, decorous, basket, cooperative, absorbing, disease, rice, voice, smash, smite, swell, club, better, ceaseless, improve, abate, tent, cut, brief, astonishing, power, overtake, robin, field, obstruct, delightful, friction, underwear, joke\n\nFor a few extra words: fornicate the police, coming straight from the London rapid transit system.,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/v57efr/i_enjoy_the_reoccurring_realization_that_the_spy/,False"

"nosleep,Jhsgts,I thought I had a stalker but now I think I\u2019m dealing with something much worse.,I\u2019m writing this to let someone know what happens to me if I vanish without a trace. I can feel them watching me, waiting for when the moment is just right.  I will try to fill you in on as much as I can before I\u2019m gone. \n\nLet me start by saying that men stalking me is not new to me. In eighth grade there were two upperclassmen who would follow me home from the bus stop. I would have to race home and throw open the door before quickly locking it behind me. Some days they managed to nearly get a foot through, but thankfully our doors are heavy so I could crush them enough for a retreat. When they failed to get in they would circle around my house like sharks, taunting me until my parents came home an hour later. At one point they managed to get my phone number and they\u2019d call me and tell me private things, like the color underwear I put on right after a shower. It freaked me out well enough but no one could do anything. Eventually my parents had someone, whether it be themselves or my cousin or someone else, always escort me to and from the bus stop. That drastically reduced the boys\u2019 harassment. When I stopped riding the bus in ninth grade it stopped completely. \n\nThen in tenth grade something similar started happening. I was talking to this guy online and he began begging me for my address so he could send me love letters, I refused because he just someone I knew through mutuals. One night, after one late theatre rehearsal, I went to hop in my car to drive the four minutes to my house. I took sometime to reply to a text before backing out. When I looked up from my phone I saw a car parked next to me, I hadn\u2019t noticed it before and just thought it was a parent picking up their kid. I start my car and pull out of the school parking lot, the car follows me with no headlights on. I thought it strange since no one got in so I drove around my neighborhood trying to lose them. I thought I took enough turns when I no longer saw them behind me. I was wrong. I pulled into my driveway, got out the car and saw them parked at the foot of my driveway watching me.  \n\nEveryday that following week I would wake and all of my car doors would be open, windows down, etc. One day was pouring rain and it soaked the interior of my car. There was nothing of value taken, everything just moved around. I began locking my doors at night, something I should have already been doing admittedly. After that week things died down again. \n\nHowever for the next few years whenever  I forgot to lock my car, personal item would go missing from it. Things like a diary, a seashell, a birthday card, anything significant to me. I was a server and any loose tips would never get touched during these break ins. Sometimes my music in my CD player would start when I had it on radio the night before. Every now and then I would pull up and see someone in my bushes, lying in wait. Gone before I could see who. \n\nDuring COVID all my family stayed home all the time and the activity stopped once again. I\u2019ve gone almost three years without incident.  Up until 3 weeks ago that is. I ran into one of the boys from the bus stop at a shop in town. He recognized me before I did him. \n\nMy personal items have started going missing again. I thought it was Gabe, the boy previously mentioned. A velvet hair bow I wear all the time was in my consul now gone. A rose a friend gave me. Pages from my school journal. The usual. So you can see why I thought it was just my stalker. Until tonight. \n\nTonight I was home alone. I was cleaning, something I\u2019ve been putting off. While I was cleaning, I kept hearing faint tappings, like someone attempting to look through the windows. Then I started louder thuds and shuffling. I waited, thinking it was my family returning from their excursion. When I didn\u2019t hear their voice I went to investigate. My cat seemed jumpy so I unlock the front door and circle around to the back to see who\u2019s there. That was my plan at least. Before I could, black humanoid figures whizz past me. Two of them. They weren\u2019t humans, the lights shone directly on them. It was like a human shaped cutout in my surroundings. Like I was nearly seeing something I shouldn\u2019t be able to see. Then I noticed how eerily quiet it was. No sounds from the cicadas or creek that runs along my house. I make my way to the back door, seeing the figures dancing behind the corners of my eyes. I scare myself by triggering the motion light. Something the figures didn\u2019t do even though one of them ran right by it before I approached. \n\nI dart inside a lock the doors. My mother returns eventually and asks why all the lights are on. I explain to her what happens and she turns white, saying she\u2019s been hearing strange noises this week. Spooked, we brush it off as imagination and say goodnight. \n\nBut as I was watching TikTok tonight a video popped up, talking about Fae. That\u2019s when it hit me. Last night while sitting in my car I saw thousands of fireflies in my backyard. I joked about how it looked like Fairyland and left a little trinket for them, not truly believing in there existence. But I think those figures may have been Fae using glamour. I think my offering may have accidentally got me into something. It\u2019s almost Midsummer. That\u2019s one part of the year when their magic is strongest. They had been stealing the things from my locked car. I know it was locked. My offering was an invitation. In a few days, when they are strong enough they are going to take me to their realm. I feel it. It will be like I disappeared into thin air. I can\u2019t sleep now. Especially not when I can see their glowing yellow eyes peering into my bedroom window  from the darkness. Watching. Waiting.,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/v57gqf/i_thought_i_had_a_stalker_but_now_i_think_im/,False"

The same thing goes for poverty, starvation  and suffering amongst those who are trying or people born with next to no freedom. We can solve those problems and say that is not a humane reality and change it for the people. Life could be a gift but we need to create a way for that reality to exist, and I\u2019m just a person like you, but from my perspective that will never happen if we continue to create a reality that is a competition against people all going through the same reality. I think I understand what people mean when they say life is a game it appears that we all have the same objective and we try to get to that objective selfishly for our selves instead of creating the destination we seek, and we do it selflessly for everyone who is trying, instead of compete in a game created long before our existence and complain how much it suck, how bad it is and  that all these problems around the word need to be fixed.

"movies,Takoshi88,The Nightmare Before Christmas, viewing as an Adult,Hey everyone. I'm 27yrs old and have never seen the Nightmare Before Christmas.\n\nI'm wondering if I should. Here's some backstory for context.\n\nI grew up in a fairly conservative Christian home so there was a decent listbof movies and shows I was never allowed to watch, this being one of them. I remember pretty much everyone else in school was obsessed, especially the scene kids, emos and goths. My friend groups consisted of some scene adjacents, so plenty of love for the film there too.\n\nI never had like, a huge desire to watch it. I saw the Corpse Bride and that was...Fine. Since then I've seen a handful of Burton's work, my preference among them being James and the Giant Peach (though it's mostly nostalgia for that one)\n\nNow that I'm an adult, I feel kinda similarly about it as I did Harry Potter, curious, but not determined so-to-speak. My wife is Berrean so she doesn't like to celebrate Christmas, meaning she's no interest in seeing it haha.\n\nSo how does it hold up as a solo movie for a 27yr old bloke who has no childhood nostalgia of it?,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/v57pwd/the_nightmare_before_christmas_viewing_as_an_adult/,False"

"personalfinance,thequantumlady,Should I start with a robo advisor to be more consistent?,I'm married and between my husband (27M) and I (25F), we make about $150k combined per year before taxes, benefits, etc. We usually live off of just one salary or less anyway, which is why we were able to immediately come up with a downpayment for a house and get a new*er* car (something I've been waiting to do for years because mine was about to croak) this past year. Due to COVID delays, we'll be having a smaller wedding this summer. And we've been trying to do a few things to improve the house like getting a fence and some general maintenance.\n\nAs far as investments, we both already contribute the recommended amount to our retirement accounts. I have a few thousand dollars each in some mutual funds my grandfather started for me as a kid (nothing crazy, maybe $15k total rn) plus a few stocks I figure will be growing with a certain industry in the longer term.\n\nThese investments, though, are mostly static in the sense that, most of the time, we forget to contribute more toward them. We're both engineers so we are technical people, but he grew up in a different country and I didn't grow up with great financial literacy. We both know we should be contributing regularly but somehow it just doesn't end up getting done.\n\nMy question is, would it be better to start with a robo advisor of some sort so we can eliminate the \"forgetful\" aspect of this? We tend to be the type of people who overplan to the extent that we don't end up taking action.\n\nI'm not opposed to, at some point, taking the lead and DIYing it. But since figuring out what the best thing to do is paralyzing us, I wonder if we should just go that route so we're doing *something*. I'm personally not that interested in watching CNBC or whatever to keep up with company news, I just want to invest and forget it.,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/v57tpe/should_i_start_with_a_robo_advisor_to_be_more/,False"

She let the sandals slip from her grip as she walked toward the table.\n\nCara jumped at the unexpected sound, looking around like a frightened mouse, her grip tight on the blouse she held.\n\n\"Damn girl but you're jumpy,\" Ginger said casually as she started to change from her swimsuit.\n\nCara's head was on a swivel, her attention jumping to any little change. Ginger watched her friend with concern as she adjusted her sundress into place.\n\n\"You were jumpy when we got back to Tacoma, and I've heard it in your voice every time we talked on the phone the past month. What gives, Cara?\" Ginger turned to face her life-long friend. \"In fact, you haven't been yourself since we were in the old Lauralton Aviation plant.\"\n\nCara sat down heavily on the bed. \"I saw something,\" she said, turning her face away. \"I've run it through my mind every day since I got back, and I still can't make sense of what I saw.\"\n\nGinger watched a visible shudder ripple down her friend. She sat down next to her friend, brushing her hair  lightly with her hand. \"This isn't like you.\"\n\n\"I think I'm losing it,\" Cara sniffled.\n\nGinger quietly whispered to her friend, lightly stroking her hair. \"It's okay. Whatever it is you can tell me.\"\n\nCara hugged Ginger, hesitating before starting.\n\n\"When you walked down the hall to leave, I leaned over to look at an old photo that had been left in the display case. It was the day they received that \"E\" Award from the War Department, and I recognized my great-grandma in it.\n\n\"While I was looking at the photo I started to see drops of red appearing on it. I looked up and for a moment I'd **swear** I was looking her in the face. But before I could blink the image was gone--nothing in front of me but the dust we had kicked up by walking around.\n\n\"I turned around and there was the figure of a woman in the hallway, holding a pair of scissors. I tried to speak to her, but she didn't respond. I watched her turn and walk into the main office, then saw a stream of blood suddenly spray across the window overlooking the plant floor. She walked out of that office and into the other offices around the floor. I started to follow, looking into the offices, and in each I saw a similar scene--the figure of the woman stabbing the occupant of the office--men, women, didn't seem to matter.\n\n\"Finally she turned around and headed toward me. I **froze**, Ginger. I thought I was a goner. Just as she started to thrust with the scissors another figure appeared in front of me, collapsing onto her. I watched as the figure slid off her shoulder to the ground--Ginger, it was the image of my great-grandma! The woman walked back into the main office, leaned over and pulled a bottle from the desk. She began pouring it across the desk and around herself, then took the man's lighter from his dead hand, striking and dropping it, the office erupting in flame. She just stood there calmly, staring at me as the flames rose higher.\n\n\"The smell of smoke, a iron taste in the air--that's when I started running for the door. I don't know what that was all about. **That**'s why I think I'm losing it, Ginger. What do I do...?\"\n\nGinger hugged her best friend, rocking her gently, unsure how to help.\n\n-----\n\n(Word count: 606. Please let me know what you like/dislike about the post.

This lead to a lot of yelling and crying. I blurted out that I got raped in my home country when I was 3 years old. Her facial expression changed, and started to ask who it was. I told her that I didn't know because I was so young at that time. She then proceeded to contact my grandmother, despite me telling her to stop. I went to my bedroom and overhead their conversation. It didn't seem like she believe what I said. At that time, I didn't say anything suspicious to my parents, nor did I have any blood in my underwear. That's what my mom stated. I felt so ashamed of myself and cried for hours in my room. \n\nIt is now the next day and she has ignored me since. I do not know what to do or what to feel. I've been also questioning my own experience, even though I have been going to therapy about ut.

"nosleep,thechedarcheesman,There's an \"Owl\" Outside.,It was June 23rd, three years ago. I was visiting my mother, as she isn't much longer for the world and I haven't seen her in such a great deal of time.\n\n I had pulled into my mother's driveway, inside of my 2009 Toyota Camry, eager to see her once more. I got out and walked up to the door, knocking on the painted green, antique wood. My mother answered with an eager grin, and invited me in.\n\n The green recliner in the corner, the large sofa, and the old TV felt so familiar. I saw that she had made something too eat. I couldn't tell if it was ham or turkey, as it was in a different room, as well as being cut up. I told her I was thankful and she didn't have to do this for me, as I can cook myself, and wanted to make her something myself.\n\nShe said not to mention it, as she was my mother. After the meal, she asked if I could stay the night. As she asked that, I thought I heard a tap on the window of the back door.\n\n I looked over and saw a blur, but brushed it off, as I had worked for over 7 hours today. A few hours passed of talking and watching TV and so we were ready to rest for the night, when I heard something. I looked out the window from the same back door, and I was greeted by an abnormally large, and strange looking great horned owl.\n\n My mother saw as well, and said she'd seen it all the time. It stared straight at me and something looked off. It looked like a mask instead of a face. Suddenly, it started getting closer, closer even closer. I locked the door quickly, dead locked, chained locked and all, as it crept closer it looked more and more like a man.\n\n Once it got to the door, my fear was proved correct. It was a 7'10 lanky man, with an owl mask that was melted into the skin on his face. He was so skinny, that his ribs, and spine was visible. It had looked as if he hadn't eaten in months. He had strange, talon-like hands and feet. he was wearing a black jumpsuit of some sort, also seemingly melted into his skin. \n\nHe cocked his head, looking at us. I ran and grabbed the butcher knife. When I looked back, my mother was in pure disgust, so I had ran back to see, only to see his long, extended neck twisting in a grotesque spiral.\n\n I got my mother and ran into the bed room, locked her in the closet, and hid behind the opened door with the knife in hand. I looked through the crack, he was already there. I knew I locked the door. He entered the room, not noticing me.\n\n In my blind fear, I showed my coward's back, and I had ran. On my way out, I came to my senses, and realized I had left my mother, but it was too late, I heard it. the mincemeat, the screams, turned to wheezes, the struggling, I couldn't bare it.\n\n I had left the house after hearing it, on the way to my car, I hear the tapping of footsteps, fast footsteps. I had gotten to my car, and saw him right at the window. I drove away, feeling terrible over what I've sacrificed.\n\n I called the police as soon as I got home, and told them what happened. They checked, and found not even a single trace of human DNA besides my mother's. I've mostly got over it, but it still haunts me. And as I sleep tonight, I hear a tapping, a tapping at my bedroom window.,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/v58cuw/theres_an_owl_outside/,False"

"funny,fritos786,My first & last date with my high school crush,High school was rough & I was no exception. My balls hadn\u2019t fully dropped until the end of my senior year. It was the last week of high school and grew the courage to ask my crush out. Einstein said time in relative. Those were the longest 5 seconds of my life. The universe decided that moment in time to throw some good my way. She said yes! The next few months were blissful. I was living in cloud 9. Nothing went bad, I didn\u2019t get yelled at, lost weight & most importantly I was dating my crush. \n\nOur first semester of college was going great. We were a few hours apart but no biggie. We talked everyday, FT & what not. One weekend I decided I\u2019m gonna surprise her by driving 4 hours to her college. She was so happy to see me. She wanted to go out and I was exhausted from the drive but for her I\u2019d do anything. I told her tomorrow night we will stay in and have a movie night. Friday night, we do our thing, hit up a few bars and have a good time. \n\n The next day, she had to meet up with her group to finish a project. I grab myself lunch for us. Taco Bell was the nearest & cheapest thing. For $5 I got a good amount & a butt load of fire sauce. She comes back after a few hours, we talk, and decide what movie to watch.  \n\nIn the middle of the movie, my stomach starts to make whale mating sounds and I\u2019m playing it off like it\u2019s nothing. A few minutes later, the whale comes back with a couple friends and my crush ask me if I was okay. I played it off like it was nothing but I\u2019m having a meltdown inside. I slowly get up and walk to the bathroom slowly but that\u2019s when all hell broke loose. Not only did I shat myself but left a ungodly smell. That smell not only make her dorm room inhabitable but that whole floor. \n\nI quickly cleaned up, grabbed my stuff and ran out there faster than light. Longest four hour drive back home\n\nIt\u2019s been a few years & we\u2019ve never spoken sense that day. I heard rumors that whole floor had to be cleaned out and it took a week.

(i know that this is a huge issue for a lot of other folks regarding new sexual experiences) \n\neventually i ditched that guy and there forward let people know that anal was off the table for me for as a whole. \n\nthen i began dating some folks who were very much into receiving anal play and penetration themselves, and i started realizing that maybe a lot of my hesitation was out of a lack of control in that initial situation. \n\ni have had a good experience figuring out for myself how to sort of \u201ctop\u201d in that situation, that\u2019s actually been really fun and empowering and helped me learn more about more of the really intricate dynamics of consent and intentional pleasure. \n\nand just tonight, while i was dirty talking with my long-term LDR partner, he mentioned how eager he is for me to have him that way.. and it really kinda made my mind switch. like when it\u2019s someone i genuinely have trust and love and chemistry with, i feel so much more comfortable to approach something that\u2019s still kind of new to me. \n\nit just sort of hit me that this has been something pretty impactful on me as a whole. i\u2019m lucky to have had a pretty healthy way of starting to process it.\n\n(and for full tmi, i had a really good time playing around myself as a result, and it makes me feel a whole lot less uncomfortable. and definitely more eager to have some fun with my man \ud83d\ude09)\n\nTLDR: i was mildly traumatized by some sexual past, but have been learning to overcome with some much more pleasant recent experiences. \n\n\n\n\n\nunkown,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/v58kls/getting_over_some_past_bad_sxual_experiences/,True"

At the time I was so I said yes that I was a pentecostal Christian (also a batshit crazy cult). She told me pentecostals were full of shit (shocker) and then began deep throating this apostal asshole. Like I swear she and her husband dick rode him hard!!!! They legit thought this guy was like a god! At the time it pissed me off so much because of christian reasons but now as an athiest I hate that guy even more!!!!! He legit is a piece of shit and I always knew there was something really wrong about him. 2018 happens and he gets caught by the US government which is GREAT because I'm sure that the Mexican government wouldn't have done shit to him. The point I'm trying to make is that putting these assholes in jail is a step in the right direction. He is not the only one and not all of them get prosecuted but I'm glad that something will happen to him. Now I've heard he may get 16 years which ain't shit but it's a start I guess.

"personalfinance,jimw237,Thinking of selling all of my stock and investing the majority of it into a rental property in Dallas.,I am 25 making roughly $70k a year (including bonus). After 401k contribution and taxes, I bring home roughly $2200 bi-weekly. I have $38,500 invested in stocks at the moment. I do not have a savings or emergency fund, all of my money is in the market. I live in DFW, my rent is $1450, car payment $322, insurance $160 and bills approx $350. $200 for gas and $300 for groceries. I basically live paycheck to paycheck though as I do have a bad spending habit that I have been turning around in recent months. I currently have no CC debt either.\n\nMy question is, given my financial circumstances and young age, would selling off my stock portfolio (currently $38,500 but down 25%) and then using it to invest in a rental property be the best idea for me? If not, what would be my best option other than that or the stock market? \n\nI live in DFW and currently the housing market is insane. The city is growing extremely fast and thats why I believe real estate my be my best option, however, and I\u2019m gonna be honest; I have no clue what I\u2019m doing when it comes to real estate, but I am also extremely pessimistic about the current state of the market and investing in it at the moment, so real estate has caught my attention..

If at all? Is cutting my losses and going an even cheaper route than $2,352 an option to consider? Can I afford to go even higher to a $3,000/mo apartment and be left with \\~$620/mo?  \n\n\nWill living in a nicer place impact my friendships? Sex life?

"personalfinance,Big-Studio8960,Need to fit groceries in this budget in a realistic way,I'm a SAHM and my husband is the only source of our household income. His gross is about 158k a year and net is about 130k, so our take home is about 10k a month ( love Texas due to no state tax haha). My biggest concern is our grocery budget, not necessarily because I have a problem with it, but I'm more so confused and would like to be enlightened as to how some people spend ridiculously little amounts on groceries. I see numbers such as 500 to feed a family of 5 and I'm flabbergasted. I don't buy pre packaged anything, I'm an avid, almost pro cook and make absolutely everything from scratch. Only packaged item is broth as I'd rather die than cook my rice or pasta with just water lol\nI know we buy lots of fresh fruit and veggies, but how are some people spending so little, are they just eating beans and rice ? How are some families spending 300 to feed a family of four!  Lastly, based on the breakdown below, is my grocery budget realistic? Too much? Too little? I would love to spend less and save more on food, but is that even possible without sacraficing good food and veggies and meat and fish?. OH and we don't eat out unless on vacation or we're going to be out all day. \nOur main bills are ..\nRent 1850\nCar 883\nCar insurance 103\nLofe insurance 60\nDisability insurance 230\nCredit car bills, debt, and student loans ( I have a graduate science degree), 1500 a months \n2 kids in diapers and one on formula ( 400 a month for formula and 200 a month for diapers for 2 plus about 60 a month for wipes )\nInternet 90\nEnergy 200ish \nWater 65\nParking 70\nValet trash 35 ( can't get out of this one)\nGroceries 1400 with toiletries \n\nI'm not including fun expenses or clothing expenses ( we spend very little on clothes and shoes because I'm very much a minimalist, so even though we do buy ourselves and our kids high end clothing, it's very very little of it),https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/v557gw/need_to_fit_groceries_in_this_budget_in_a/,False"

The same is the case of country/state borders. While observing the state borders (USA) I woul conclude the straight lines are the evidence the states weren\u2019t fighting but the borders were arranged. The same is with cadastre blocks. The people that came from Europe were provided with certain block of certain size in exchange for labor.\n\nIn Europe, I don\u2019t know what were the principles for granting people land (and taking it back). Was there any case of government redistributing private land in certain circumstances (excepting communist regimes)?\n\nI live in ex communist country and many people over here still advocate communist ideas of redistributing ownership by applying \u2018fair share\u2019. By the historical evidence known to me, I can\u2019t find the example of such case in which society as a whole benefited long term.\n\nOn one hand I believe people should have right to freely access to the sea and drinking water but I believe it is also fair to award those who turn the wild coast to usable beach and enable the rest to drink water without digging themselves.\n\nSo actually the question is were there different principles that determined the relationship of inheritance, labor, and ownership, such as free market and something else or were there any other rules throughout different societal structures that laid foundations for today\u2019s free market?,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/v591f9/what_principles_did_kingdomsgovernments_apply_to/,False"

This is how Wikipedia defines it, but it also says that half of YA readers are adults, which seems to be contradictory. Or does it designate books whose main characters are teenagers ? But classifying books by the age of the protagonists also seem foolish, since I have read books whose main characters were teenagers or children that were pretty dark and complex, and that felt more like books for adults that could still be read by teenagers and children rather than \"Young Adult Books\" or \"Children's Books\". So there doesn't seem to be an easy answer for me.\n\nSo I thought I would ask readers of Young Adult fiction what, in their opinion, makes a book \"YA\" ?

It\u2019s the house I\u2019ve lived in for all 24 years of my life and truthfully I would never want to sell it. She\u2019s also paid a large chunk of it off and owes less then 100k on it and it\u2019s valued at over 600k. So I\u2019m curious that if she passes will I be able to take over the payments for her (assuming she passes before it\u2019s completely paid off)? She has me and my brother in her will, and entrusted the house to us when she passes but I\u2019m not sure how it will play out if she passes before it\u2019s paid off. It\u2019s something I\u2019ve always worried about, but my knowledge in that field is pretty limited. Will I be forced to sell it or will the bank/lender allow me to continue payments on it? She only pays around $700 for the mortgage and by the time everything is said and done it\u2019s around $1400 a month which is manageable for me. I\u2019m just wanting to know what to expect.,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/v5a4bp/can_i_take_over_a_house_payment_if_my_grandmother/,False"

What is going on?\n\nI like the first Orphan movie. It was really good. After watching the other ending for that movie, I think the first ending was the best outcome. But what if the original ending was actually not the real ending? Like, Esther had already killed the family, but the mom and daughter are caught in some kind of loop dimension where they repeat everything in the movie up until Esther's death and thought that they had killed Esther when they really are caught up in a loop while their real world is going forward?

"nosleep,DrForrester87,Something in the Storm Drain.,A few of years ago I worked at a small Italian restaurant as a bus boy. It was busy, thankless, and paid like shit, but it was work. I wasn\u2019t going to take that for granted, I had gotten laid off during the recession so I took what I could get. Anyway, I spent my breaks in the alley way back behind the restaurant so I could smoke in peace. Normally the only company I kept out there were some bugs flying around the light just off to the right of the door and maybe a rat or two. If I was lucky an alley cat would slink by and I could kick an empty can or discard bottle at it. The little things amuse you when your life consists of washing dishes and clearing tables. \n\nThis one night, I\u2019m out there smoking a cigarette and this wino comes staggering my direction from the far end of the alley. The guy reeked so bad I could smell him thirty feet away. He got within yelling distance and mumbled something incoherent. I dropped my cigarette and stomped it out and told the guy I didn\u2019t have any money to give him and turned to open the door. Just before I went back to work I looked at him and sternly warned him to stay the hell out of dumpster. I wasn\u2019t nice about it and maybe I should have been, you know? But, I wasn\u2019t. \n\nFinally, my shift comes to an end and I\u2019m going to take the couple bags of garbage out. I open the back door, set the two bags down, light up another cigarette and head over to the dumpster. I had just managed to open the lid when I heard a moan. I leaned over to my left and I could see a pair of crusty looking shoes. I shook my head and tossed both bags in before slamming the lid down. I went around the front to see the homeless guy was sitting there propped up against the wall of the restaurant. I looked him over and asked if he was getting into our garbage. The guy muttered and mumbled while dismissively waving his hand. I think he was telling me \u2018no\u2019 but for all I know this guy could have been trying to explain how those guys back in ancient Egypt made the pyramids. \nI was ready to leave when I decided to ask if the guy wanted a smoke. He looked up at me and I could tell he wanted one. I pulled out a cigarette and gave it to him. He put it in his mouth and gestured his hands for me to come in and light it for him. I took out my lighter and, holding my breath, leaned in and lit it up. He took a drag and mumbled his way through a thank you and then I told him he shouldn\u2019t sleep in this alley. There was a shelter a few blocks away and I told him he needed to go there because they\u2019d have a bed for him. He said something I didn\u2019t understand and I waved him a goodnight and turned to go around to the street where my car was.\n\nAs I was walking past the steps to the door, I heard something back down the alley fall over. I stopped and turned around thinking it was another homeless guy or a cat or raccoon or something had knocked over a garbage can. It was poorly lit so I didn\u2019t really see anything. I waited a second before flicking my cigarette and going about my business. I was almost out of sight when I swore I heard a growl or something. I glanced over my shoulder but by now I was far too tired to really care.\n\nI went home, took a shower, had a beer and watched some TV and then went to bed. I arrived at work to start my shift and my boss, Angelo, started yelling at me about how when he showed up there was trash all over the alley by the dumpster. I cursed under my breath. Of course the homeless guy was going to go rummaging through the dumpster when I was gone. Why wouldn\u2019t he? I told him there\u2019d been a homeless guy the night before and that I\u2019d told him to go to the shelter after explicitly telling him to stay away from our trash. Angelo went off on some tirade about the homeless and I just sort of tuned him out and got ready for the dinner crowd. When break time came, I went back to my usual spot near the door to have a cigarette. There was still a bunch of garbage all over and I could only shake my head. I was just about done with break when I heard a shuffling noise just around the corner near where the dumpster was.\n\nMaybe my friend was back for more? I started walking that way and when I got in front of the dumpster I could see the alley was empty save the tiny silhouette of a rat darting across the open space near the far end. I looked around at the mess the homeless guy left when I saw something out of place. About ten feet or so from the dumpster was a crusty looking shoe. After a long, thoughtful drag on my cig I decided to investigate a little. I walked over to the shoe and prodded it with my foot. It had been on its side but I managed to nudge it enough that it flopped over onto the sole. The thing was absolutely rancid and covered in caked on filth. I looked around again to see if maybe the guy was curled up in a dark corner somewhere but he was nowhere to be found.\nI began walking back and wondering if the guy was so messed up he just lost a shoe and didn\u2019t notice when I saw something else. Just off to the side of the dumpster was a half-used cigarette. Looking at it drew my eyes to the side of the dumpster. I couldn\u2019t see well as it was dark green and the lighting was shit back there. But there was something darker smattered on the side. I moved in for a closer look. I didn\u2019t dare touch it; God only knows what nasty diseases I could contract from the mystery substance to say nothing of the dumpster in general. While I was looking this over, I heard the door fly open and Angelo call out to me. I stood up and asked him to come take a look at whatever it was.\n\nHe came over angrily and when I pointed the dark splatter out he just shrugged it off and told me to get back inside and clear tables. I didn\u2019t think a whole lot about it during the rest of my shift. That kind of busy work tends to just push all complex thought out of your mind while you\u2019re doing it. At last closing time was upon us and I was doing the last bit of nightly clean up. Like usual, Angelo told me to take out the last bit of garbage before I went home and this time he told me to make sure there weren\u2019t any dumpster diving homeless people waiting to rifle through it when we were gone.\n\nThat night it was one bag so I grabbed it and made my way to the back door like I normally did. I opened the door, set the bag down, lit up a cigarette, and away I went. As I closed the lid, having deposited my bag into the dark abyss of the dumpster\u2019s insides, I mindlessly flicked the ash off my cigarette and let out a sigh. I happened to look to my right and noticed something. The shoe was gone. Had Drunky come back for his shoe? Putting my cigarette back into my mouth, I went over to where it was. Just like before there wasn\u2019t any sign of this guy anywhere in the alley so I shrugged and decided I\u2019d done enough for the night. I was just starting to pivot on my heel to leave when I heard a shuffling from behind me.\n \nI glanced back but I didn\u2019t see anything. But there had definitely been something there. I called out a \u2018hello\u2019 but got no answer. There\u2019s a little loading dock back there where we get supplies dropped off. It sounded like it came from over that way. There wasn\u2019t a lot of light there because the dock lights were mostly burnt out and the one that was working had a covering so encrusted with dirt and grime it wasn\u2019t much more powerful than an old lantern.  I slowly made my way over to the docking area and squinted to see if I could make anything out. I really couldn\u2019t, though. I decided to take out my phone and use the flashlight on it. I slowly shone the light over the dark spaces of the loading dock. Nothing\u2014not a single sign of anyone or anything. Whatever, I didn\u2019t want to waste anymore time. I had just moved my thumb to close the app when I heard a low growl. My thumb froze and I slowly brought the phone up. I scanned the area once again and once again I saw nothing. Against my better judgment, I started moving further down the alley.\n\nFinally, I came to a spot where there was a storm drain. I immediately noticed two things: the grating was ajar and the homeless guy\u2019s shoe was sticking out of it. I looked around quickly to see if anyone was around and then I walked toward it. At first I just shined my light down the drain to see if I could catch a glimpse of anything. Was the homeless guy sleeping in the sewer? That would explain why he smelled so bad. But, I couldn\u2019t see crap. I don\u2019t know why but I reached down to pull the shoe out. Just as my fingers reached it, there was a weird hiss and something shot out from the drain and grabbed my arm. \nI screamed and dropped my phone; my cigarette fell out of my mouth and bounced down my shirt as I pulled against whatever this was. When I looked to see what was clamped onto me, I saw what appeared be an arm. The arm was pale and kind of scaly. The grip was so strong it felt like my arm was going to be crushed. In desperation I clawed at it but no avail. Finally, I got up and stomped on the drain grating several times until the thing let out a yelp and loosed its hold on me a bit. It was enough for me to rip free but the thing\u2019s claws cut my arm pretty bad. I ran for my life back into the restaurant yelling and screaming out of my mind. My boss and his wife were still there as well as one of the waitresses. \nAngelo saw me and started yelling about how I was bleeding on is floor. There was a lot of confused shouting as they were trying to figure out what was going on. His wife ushered me to the sink to start tending to my injuries while Angelo continued to badger me about why I was bleeding all over his kitchen. I told him something grabbed me from the storm drain. I wheezed out about the homeless guy and his shoe and how I found it over there after I heard some noises. Angelo looked at me like I had grown a second head. The waitress didn\u2019t say or do anything, she just watched in silence. I know what I was telling them didn\u2019t make any sense. At least Angelo\u2019s wife was kind enough to pretend to hear what I was saying.\n \nAfter things had calmed slightly, Angelo grabbed a flashlight and went to investigate the storm drain himself. He came back a few minutes later with my phone. He handed it to me and said the drain was covered and no scaly arm lunged out at him. He laughed a bit at the thought and then told me I probably had run afoul of a cat or something. This ignored the fact that the cuts on my arm were too big to be a cat. His wife bandaged me up the best she could and then they sent me home. I had the next day off and went in to get my arm looked at and got some stitches. Upon my return to work, I discovered my late night encounter had become something of a joke among the staff. People would make wisecracks about unknown creatures or ask me to tell the story to them with huge shit-eating grins. Occasionally, someone would wait around the corner and lunge out at me or try to grab me. That stopped when I freaked out and hit one of the other bus boys with a tray in the face which fortunately Angelo never found out about.\n\nThe fact that I wouldn\u2019t go near the back alley also seemed to amuse my coworkers to no end. I\u2019d been ribbed and endlessly ridiculed about it for three or four months. All the while, I was having legit issues stemming from what happened. I started having trouble sleeping and began to drink more. I got really jumpy and sudden loud noises sent me into panic mode. I got more irritable with people, which at a job with a short-tempered, middle-aged, Italian man running the show could get\u2026interesting. \nI know the changes weren\u2019t unnoticed but no one at work bothered to say anything about it. Even after the jokes had largely ceased, I wasn\u2019t any better. I flatly refused to out back even a full year later. It didn\u2019t matter that other employees had gone back there and not had anything strange happen to them. It didn\u2019t matter that Angelo put up a camera back there after we got broken into and it never captured any footage of something crawling out of the drain. I just wouldn\u2019t do it.  Angelo thought I was being a baby but he eventually gave up trying to get me to go out there. I think deep down he knew something had to have happened. Even if he didn\u2019t believe in sewer monsters, something messed me up and he knew it.\n \nIn late 2019, Angelo had a massive heart attack and died. His son, Jackie, tried to run the place but he wasn\u2019t any good at it. The restaurant limped into 2020 just in time for the pandemic to deal it the death blow. We had been barely hanging on as it was since Angelo died and the lockdowns ended the whole thing. I wasn\u2019t sad to have to find work elsewhere, truth-be-told. I got a different job and tried to move on with my life the best I could. I didn\u2019t bring up what happened that night to anyone but my sister. I know she didn\u2019t believe me, either. But she at least tried to pretend to be supportive because clearly I was dealing with some big problems. \n\nI had a nightmare about it a few months ago and she suggested I go back and face my fear. I was\u2026colorful in describing what I thought of that idea but the over the course of a couple of weeks I decided maybe I should do it. I went during the day. The restaurant was still closed up, no one had bought it yet and likely no one will. I walked down the asphalt toward that drain. I\u2019d be lying if I said didn\u2019t need some liquid encouragement before going through with it. When my feet finally came to rest at the edge of the grating I just stopped and stared into the darkness. There wasn\u2019t any noise; there was no homeless guy\u2019s shoe. There was just me and the drain. \n\nI stomped on the grating a few times. Nothing\u2026just nothing\u2026I started to feel stupid about the whole thing. I lit up a cigarette and looked over the alleyway. When I was done with it; I looked down at the drain and scoffed and flipped the darkness off. I dropped the cigarette down between the space in the grating and I watched the cherry bounce off something half way down--something that hissed. My nuts flew up into my throat and my ass cheeks clinched together so tight that they could have crushed a lump of coal into a diamond. \n\nI bolted back toward my car and never looked back. Later I called my sister and I told her I\u2019d gone the alley and that there wasn\u2019t anything there. She sounded so relieved that I had been able to conquer my fear. I put on a pretty good show, I guess. After that I purposely started talking to her less so she wouldn\u2019t see that I\u2019m still messed up\u2014functioning but still messed up. I know she\u2019s suspicious that I\u2019m still dealing with this and has brought up therapy a couple of times since I went back to the alley. \nBut I don\u2019t want to see a therapist. All they\u2019re gonna do is tell me I\u2019m obsessing about some childhood BS and give me a prescription for pills to make me all funny in the head. I can get the same results from a bottle of whiskey for helluva a lot less fuss and money.\n\nI don\u2019t know what the hell that thing was in the drain. I don\u2019t want to know. It\u2019s real, that much I do know and I have good reason to believe it killed that homeless guy and it attacked me. I have the scars on my arm to prove it. That tells me all I need to know about it. I\u2019m still skittish around storm drains even when I\u2019m out of town. Sometimes I catch myself being paranoid to a ridiculous degree. Like the shower drain or the toilet; absurd stuff like that. It had a hold of me for maybe fifteen to twenty seconds but it\u2019s lived rent free in my mind ever since and it\u2019s ruined me mentally and emotionally. So if you\u2019re ever passing by a storm drain and you hear growling or hissing or something goes bump in the night, do yourself a favor and keep walking and don\u2019t stop to investigate. It\u2019s not worth it.,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/v5a6vl/something_in_the_storm_drain/,False"

"tifu,JohnnyLett,TIFU by playing a dodgy wanking game,Obligatory not me - but a great story from my school days. \n\nI used to have this rank mate at school. Every teenage boy friend group has a rank friend - and he was ours. \n\nLike most teenage boys, his favourite past time was wanking. However, unlike us who were content with beating our meat to soft core magazine pornography, or some internet grot, this boy - let\u2019s call him Bob - had a special game he would play to get his kicks. \n\nThis game was called Mum.\n\nWhat Bob used to do was start wanking to whatever filth he had at his disposal, and then just before he was about to cum, he\u2019d shout for his mum. \n\nThis meant that he had a very short window to shoot his muck, hide the porn, clean himself up, and think of an excuse for calling his mum before she barged in. \n\nIt\u2019s a gambit few others would take, and the thought of dealing with your mum in the last throes of a wank would make most shudder.\n\nThis is where Bob was different. The more and more he played this game, the more and more he needed the rush of the risk to get his rocks off. Like I said - Bob was rank. He used to love regaling us with the tails of how he\u2019d almost been caught. Bob thought he was pretty cool. \n\nThis is the story of the day Bob came unstuck. \n\nBob had been shopping with his mum and had helped her get the shopping in. He knew this gave him a 10 minute window whilst she was on the ground floor putting the shopping away. 10 minutes was more than enough time for Bob, so he slipped upstairs, fired up his computer, and got his chap out. \n\nBeating away to whatever he quickly found from the extensive collection on his hard drive, the time drew near. \n\nAt the top of his lungs he yelled \u201cMUUUUM\u201d\n\nBut Bob fucked up. Because Bob\u2019s mum had not stayed downstairs in the kitchen, and he\u2019s been too preoccupied with his hand to gland activities to hear the movement in the hallway outside. \n\nBob jizzed all over his hands as per usual (he always had really soft hands - I guess this was why). \n\nThat\u2019s when he heard the floorboard a few steps from his door. FUCK. \n\nFirst step - trousers up. The second floorboard creaked as Bob minimised the porn. Step three and the door creaks open. Bob realises he has Jizz all over his hands. At this moment, something breaks in Bob\u2019s brain and he decides his only option is to eat it. \n\nLike a hungry anteater he slurps up his love gunk and gulps it down like a trooper. \n\nMaybe she saw him and chose to ignore it, or maybe she was oblivious. Hell, maybe she used to play mum as a kid and knew exactly what her perverted little son was up to. \n\nEitherway, Bob managed to make up some shit excuse about his computer making a strange noise and his mum chose to let it go. \n\nHe told one of our friends this under strict confidence, so most of the school knew by lunchtime the next day. \n\nBob was fucking rank. \n\nThis one was sent in to our TIFU podcast The Thread of Gentlemen and the OP didn\u2019t mind us sharing.

"TwoXChromosomes,Gaajar_aka_Carrot,Is anyone else disturbed by the fact that whenever you search a female character or female actress on Reddit mobile, the top posts are generally NSFW. But that's not the case with male characters and male actors.,Just search Scarlet Witch and Black Widow and then search Thor, Iron Man, etc. and you will now.\n\nI got to know about this when I searched for Stranger Things actress Millie Bobby Brown. All the top posts on Reddit mobile were NSFW. Then to investigate I searched for other Stranger Things actresses and it was the same case. Then I searched for the male actors, but it was not the same case. So while the male actors' top posts where generally about their character, interview, posts appreciating their talent, etc. female actresses' top posts were their NSFW pics and posts sexualizing and objectifying them.\n\nI feel extremely disturbed by this.\n\nThat's not it. There is already a 18+ subreddit of Millie Bobby Brown, who just turned 18 this year, with more than 35k+ members. The comments were horrible with people calling her slut and whore and some that I don't even want to write.\n\nActresses like Elizabeth Olsen, Scarlett Johansson, Hailee Steinfeld, etc. have subs with so many members. In comparison the male ones have subs with very less members. I first thought maybe more people appreciate the talents of female actresses. But no, the subs have a different purpose. The top posts of all time in these subs are generally NSFW. \n\nSearch literally any female character, whether iconic or not and you'll get plenty of arts and pics sexualizing and objectifying them with thousands of upvotes. I searched for Spiderman but I didn't find any of his. Instead I found plenty for Spiderman female characters like MJ, Gwen, Black Cat, etc.\n\nIt's a bit disturbing to see characters like Hermione Granger, Korra, Toph, Katara, Disney princesses and other female characters (whom I have grown with since childhood) having so many NSFW pics of people objectifying them so much with thousands of upvotes.\n\nThe thing that's bugging me the most is that this is so rare for male actors and characters in comparison.\n\nI feel like a lot of people see female characters and actresses as just thirst quenching devices or sex objects.\n\nI don't know.

No endless scratching to get the remains out by the end, except for the very bottom.\n\nI know, right?

Now she thinks I think she's fat and I'm validating her thoughts of her being fat and hates the idea of being around me because she thinks that's how I now see her.\n\nWe had been apart for some time and I said I missed her and was looking at old photos because I love and fancy her. She asked why I fancy her, so I pointed out how much I love getting lost in her eyes, her smile, things about her personality.  Then I said I love your body and your curves. I know she's insecure about her body and wants to lose weight so she can be more comfortable in herself. \n\nI know I messed up by saying 'curves' but I didn't think that was a bad thing because curves isn't synonymous with weight. I wanted to reassure her that I do love her and want her. I've always told her she's hot and gorgeous and we have a very active sex life.\n\nWhat this has turned into is that she thinks that because I said curves, I fancy her because she's fat and I'm validating her thoughts about her being fat. Which is not the case, cause she isn't. I've tried to reassure her that I fancy her and would fancy her if she lost weight. \n\nNow she doesn't even want me in front of her or me to be around her because she feels horrendous and thinks because I fancy her in her current body that I'm either lying or only fancy her because of how she is currently, which she doesn't want to be.,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/v5amqy/tifu_by_telling_my_gf_i_like_her_curves_and_now/,False"

"TwoXChromosomes,Lylibean,She probably wouldn\u2019t mind watching the kids,Had a minor \u201cum, have we met?\u201d moment with my SO this afternoon that has resulted in my being up all night - birds have been singing for an hour already - so I decided to get it off my chest in the hope I\u2019ll get a nap before \u201creal morning\u201d.  I thought you guys might appreciate the story.\n\nThis (well, yesterday at this point) morning, my SO, his dad, and I did some work at our greenhouse space, which is located on one our good friend\u2019s farm.  After we made all the plants happy, we went to an estate sale to have a look at the woodworking tools and machines listed for sale.  My SO got an amazing deal on a wood planer, but we had to drop back by the farm for a little while, so he let the guy running the sale know we would be back in a couple of hours to retrieve it.\n\nWhen we got back to the farm, my SO was telling our farmer friend about everything we found, and then he asked if our friend could come back with us to pick up the planer, as it was extremely heavy and we needed as many hands as possible.  He declined, as both his sons were at home and his wife was still at work.\n\n\u201cLylibean probably wouldn\u2019t mind watching the kids while we go back over there.\u201d\n\nHARD FUCKING STOP.\n\nI have never been shy about telling anyone that I am the LAST person you would ever want to watch your kids, and my SO is well aware of this.  I\u2019ve had a strong dislike for children since I was about 4 years old that has continued throughout my entire 41 years on this planet.  You want me to watch your kids?  Remember, \u201cfuck\u201d, \u201cgoddammit\u201d and \u201csonofabitch\u201d are practically every other word out of my mouth, and my reflex reaction to an obstinate child is to slap the shit out of them.  (Seriously, my hand will reach out and pop that cherubic little face like a cobra striking its next meal before I even realize my arm is in motion - I inherited this reflex from my mom and grandma.)  Because of these things, I stay as far away from children as possible.  I\u2019m an \u2018R\u2019 rated person, not suitable for children without parental guidance.\n\nBut, because I\u2019m a woman, it\u2019s automatically assumed I would be delighted to watch the children.  That would be a loud, resounding \u201cfuck you, ya goddamned sonofabitch\u201d from ole Lylibean.\n\nNow, don\u2019t get me wrong, they are sweet kids and not some hellspawned crotch goblins like practically every kid I\u2019ve ever been around in my life.  But hell-to-the-NO, zero exceptions.\n\nAnd I said as much.  SO tried to coerce me for about ten minutes (while his dad chuckled and shook his head in the background).  The \u201cmotherly instinct\u201d software was never installed in my brain, and I would probably toss kids willy-nilly into a lava flow to clear my path of escape to save myself.  (Animals, however, are a totally different story!)\n\nSome people might think that makes me an asshole, but I would never, say, force an arachnophobe to babysit a room full of spiders, for example.  I\u2019m so tired of people thinking that just because I\u2019m a woman (especially one with no kids) that I\u2019m just dying to watch someone\u2019s kids.  I wouldn\u2019t even watch my own nephew for fuck\u2019s sake, and he\u2019s pretty cool for a little dude.  At least I\u2019m old enough now that people have stoped reminding me that my \u201cclock is ticking\u201d or asking when I\u2019m going to \u201cchange my mind\u201d and have a baby.\n\nNow, if you have dogs, cats, horses, cows, goats, sheep, chickens, turtles, fish, snakes, or lizards, I\u2019ll watch any or even all of them for you and have a great time doing it.  Plenty of experience doing that. \n\nBut I will not be watching your children (or spiders for that matter!).  Of all the \u201cwomanly\u201d things I will not do, this is #2 on my list (behind \u201chaving a baby\u201d in the #1 spot, of course).,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/v5andg/she_probably_wouldnt_mind_watching_the_kids/,False"

"atheism,CoffeeAndZyn,Looking To Create The Best Atheist Breakdown of Genesis,So I'll show you what I have done so far, but I'm looking for someone who's a little more \"punctual\" / educated than me to assist me in creating the best version of this. \n\n\\*Please refrain from any childish atheist antics such as mocking God / saying God doesn't exist etc.\\* \n\n**Genesis 1:1 In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.** **2 Now the earth was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters.** \n\nSo, if he\u2019s talking about \u201cthe heavens\u201d as in the dwelling place of God / The Angels, that means The Earth was created before anything else in The Universe? I\u2019m not sure how The Universe is 13.8 billion years old and The Earth is 4.543 billion years old then? \n\n**3 And God said, \u201cLet there be light,\u201d and there was light.** **4 God saw that the light was good, and he separated the light from the darkness.** **5 God called the light \u201cday,\u201d and the darkness he called \u201cnight.\u201d And there was evening, and there was morning\u2014the first day.** \n\nGod creates day and night, before he creates the Sun? Honestly, doesn\u2019t make sense.\n\n**6And God said, \u201cLet there be a vault between the waters to separate water from water.\u201d** **7 So God made the vault and separated the water under the vault from the water above it. And it was so.** **8 God called the vault \u201csky.\u201d And there was evening, and there was morning\u2014the second day.**\n\nI\u2019m guessing this means he separated the waters (Or moisture?) in the sky from the waters of the earth. Couldn\u2019t find any clear results for what it exactly means by this\u2026 \n\n**9 And God said, \u201cLet the water under the sky be gathered to one place, and let dry ground appear.\u201d And it was so.** **10 God called the dry ground \u201cland,\u201d and the gathered waters he called \u201cseas.\u201d And God saw that it was good.** \n\n**11 Then God said, \u201cLet the land produce vegetation: seed-bearing plants and trees on the land that bear fruit with seed in it, according to their various kinds.\u201d And it was so.** **12 The land produced vegetation: plants bearing seed according to their kinds and trees bearing fruit with seed in it according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good.** **13 And there was evening, and there was morning\u2014the third day.**\n\nThe origin of life on Earth is believed to come from a hydrothermal vent on the mid-Atlantic ridge called \u201cLost City\u201d. Elements and compounds essential to life include hydrogen, phosphates, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, methane, and ammonia. Scientists believe that billions of years ago, simple organic compounds assembled into more complex coalitions that could grow and reproduce. When it comes to plants, it is believed that they evolved from algae. (I am open to the idea that life on Earth could have either evolved, had a divine origin, or be a mix of both. I do believe in God, but also in science\u2026) \n\n**14 And God said, \u201cLet there be lights in the vault of the sky to separate the day from the night, and let them serve as signs to mark sacred times, and days and years,** **15 and let them be lights in the vault of the sky to give light on the earth.\u201d And it was so.** **16 God made two great lights\u2014the greater light to govern the day and the lesser light to govern the night. He also made the stars.** **17 God set them in the vault of the sky to give light on the earth,** **18 to govern the day and the night, and to separate light from darkness. And God saw that it was good.** **19 And there was evening, and there was morning\u2014the fourth day.**\n\nThis doesn\u2019t make sense considering the fact that Genesis 1:3-5 says, \u201c3 And God said, \u201cLet there be light,\u201d and there was light. 4 God saw that the light was good, and he separated the light from the darkness. 5 God called the light \u201cday,\u201d and the darkness he called \u201cnight.\u201d And there was evening, and there was morning\u2014the first day.\u201d I\u2019m not so sure how there was day and night without the Sun? Also, he creates plants / vegetation before the sun which doesn\u2019t make sense. \n\n**20 And God said, \u201cLet the water teem with living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the vault of the sky.\u201d** **21 So God created the great creatures of the sea and every living thing with which the water teems and that moves about in it, according to their kinds, and every winged bird according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.** **22 God blessed them and said, \u201cBe fruitful and increase in number and fill the water in the seas, and let the birds increase on the earth.\u201d** **23 And there was evening, and there was morning\u2014the fifth day.**\n\nScience talks about the evolution of simple life in the ocean evolving into more complex life and eventually fish, then somewhere along the line into birds. There\u2019s some scientific evidence that supports these ideas, but there\u2019s not concrete evidence for everything. Whatever the case may be, we can only look at the evidence we have and try to come up with the most rational explanation possible. \n\n**24 And God said, \u201cLet the land produce living creatures according to their kinds: the livestock, the creatures that move along the ground, and the wild animals, each according to its kind.\u201d And it was so.** **25 God made the wild animals according to their kinds, the livestock according to their kinds, and all the creatures that move along the ground according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good.**\n\n[**https://www.thoughtco.com/evolution-of-vertebrate-animals-4040937**](https://www.thoughtco.com/evolution-of-vertebrate-animals-4040937)\n\n**26 Then God said, \u201cLet us make mankind in our image, in our likeness, so that they may rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky, over the livestock and all the wild animals,\\[**[**a**](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%201&version=NIV#fen-NIV-26a)**\\] and over all the creatures that move along the ground.\u201d**\n\n**27 So God created mankind in his own image,**  \n  **in the image of God he created them;**  \n  **male and female he created them.**\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline\\_of\\_human\\_evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_human_evolution) \n\n**29 Then God said, \u201cI give you every seed-bearing plant on the face of the whole earth and every tree that has fruit with seed in it. They will be yours for food.** **30 And to all the beasts of the earth and all the birds in the sky and all the creatures that move along the ground\u2014everything that has the breath of life in it\u2014I give every green plant for food.\u201d And it was so.**\n\nSo, God says \u201cI give you every seed-bearing plant on the face of the whole Earth and every tree that has fruit with seed in it. They will be yours for food.\u201d So, we\u2019re only supposed to eat fruits and vegetables? I\u2019m not a vegan, however I am against slaughterhouses\u2026 I support the consumption of free-range, humanely raised animals. \n\n**31 God saw all that he had made, and it was very good. And there was evening, and there was morning\u2014the sixth day.**\n\n**2 Thus the heavens and the earth were completed in all their vast array.**\n\n**2 By the seventh day God had finished the work he had been doing; so on the seventh day he rested from all his work.** **3 Then God blessed the seventh day and made it holy, because on it he rested from all the work of creating that he had done.**\n\n\\*I have yet to hear a rational explanation for why there\u2019s two accounts of creation\\* \n\nThe fact that it says Adam was created from the dust and Eve from his rib just doesn\u2019t make sense\u2026 On top of that, they had 3 sons yet populated the entire Earth?

"movies,Key_Database9095,Hi guys. I recently watched Morbius and I realised....,That it is not that bad after all. You guys were over exaggeratting this movie so much as if it is Green Lantern 2 or Catwoman 2 or X-Men Origins Wolverine 2. No it is not so pathetic after all. Now it is not as brilliant as Spiderman 2 (2004) but hey who said every comic Book movie should be a legendary movie. Average or above average movies also perform well at the box Office. Venom 2018 was no masterpiece though it was a huge improvement over the Venom of Sam Raimi's Spiderman 3 Venom. But the movie was a lot fun. The characters were great. The action sequences were badass. They could have been better had it been Rated-R. The humour was great. the acting by every cast member was also great. Yet the critics unnecessarily gave the movie 2/5. One in a hundred critic might have given Venom 2018 3/5. But that was it from the critics side and from that movie onwards I stopped thrusting critics. Same goes for the movie. Occasionally this movie is kinda cringe. There is hardly any humour which I actually liked.As nowadays it feels like almost every Superhero movie is an Action/Comedy. The mid-credit and the post credit scene make zero sense. I would recommend you guys to stop watching the movie after the movie ends. Even before the mid-credit scene and the post credit scene. I will give this movie 3/5 or 3.5/5. It is not as enjoyable as Venom 2018 so that is why I am not giving it a 4/5. But then Morbius 2022 isn't a garbage as well.

(high-end),Listen guys; this is the situation -\n\nI'm moving to a different country, and I just sold my desktop PC.\n\nI need to buy a new system now (laptop or PC) by the end of June, and then the second system in November. I can't decide what to go for first, a gaming laptop or a gaming PC?\n\nagain, I'll get both anyway by the end of November.\n\nMy thoughts:\n\n1. I'm interested in OLED screens for my laptop, and I know they're just around the corner, and gaming 15-inch OLEDs 144hz laptops are coming out this year. So maybe better to go for a PC first?\n2. Better to give the DDR5 market a bit more time? So maybe go for a laptop first?\n3. 4000 series are just around the corner - So maybe go for a laptop first (with 3070 ti)\n4. Maybe it's wiser to go first with a decent laptop (with 3070 ti) and then a super-strong PC with the 4xxx series in November? (Hope it will be out by then)\n\nPlease spare me the \"Desktop PC is always stronger than a laptop\" - That is well known.\n\nButton line - I need to get one system by the end of June and then the second one by the end of November.\n\nSo what should I get first?

"gaming,Wamb0wneD,The Diablo Immortal pricing model is just another example of a very obvious industry tactic,This has happened time and time again now. A gaming company releases a game with a pricing model so outrageously greedy and insulting, that people get mad. \n\nWhat I feel many don't realize though is, that this is very much intentional. These fucks spend a lot of money and time on developing these imgame economies.\n\nWhat happens with Immortal right now happened with a lot of games. Recently Gran Turismo 7 and their comically expensive cars. Halo Infinite and the shitty, slow progression. Apex Legends changing rewards. Magic Arena slowly cooking their gamer frogs into more expensive spending habits. \n\nAll these companies *know* how greedy they are with this. They almost always do this so they can gauge what they can get away with. In a lot of instances, they can't. But even that is wanted. They then scale it back somewhat and \"improve\" it. \n\nWhat it actually means is that it's still an extremely shitty, predatory model, just less so than before the changes. But almost always still way worse than what we had a few years ago. Now you say \"yeah we know that already\", but here is what bothers me about this and made me write all this, my main point so to speak: Again and again, in all these different communities, I see loads of people *praising them for it*. For *listening* and *trying to improve the game*.\n\nIt's bullshit, please stop falling for it. The aren't listening to you. All they do is push the boundaries of whats acceptable, and then scale back slightly, only to try again next time and push some more. That's all they are listening to. \n\nTDLR: Stop praising companies slightly scaling back their insane ingame economy to something slightly less predatory after backlash. They planned for that.,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/v5b0yo/the_diablo_immortal_pricing_model_is_just_another/,False"

"personalfinance,bankshotzombies1,Just turned 18 and want to open a retirement account,So I\u2019ve recently turned 18, and I realized that I need to start taking my financials seriously. At first, I had about $18k from my grandfather and decided to get into stock investing. I downloaded Fidelity and remembered that you could open retirement accounts on it. I\u2019ve also heard that it\u2019s smart to start a retirement account early. \nHowever, I have no idea what type of account to open with the position I\u2019m in. I\u2019ve heard a Roth IRA is good, but I\u2019m also pretty sure you need an income to open one. I currently have no job, and I\u2019m going to university in the coming up school year. I\u2019m planning on getting a summer job which will rack in some income, but once summer is over, I won\u2019t have any job for at least 4 years. \nI have money to use if I need. My dad opened a savings/investing account (tbh I don\u2019t really know exactly what it is) when I was born, and it\u2019s racked in quite a large amount of money. \nWhat is your advice for this? My dad sounded a bit hesitant when I brought up opening a Roth IRA, saying that I won\u2019t be able to touch the money for a long time, but told me that it\u2019s my money and I should decide what to do with it. \nI don\u2019t necessarily need an exact answer for exactly what to do. I just need a little push in the right direction. Stocks, crypto, real estate, finance, retirement, etc\u2026it\u2019s all getting to me and becoming kinda confusing, and I just need a bit of guidance. \nThank you in advance.,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/v5b2ua/just_turned_18_and_want_to_open_a_retirement/,False"

"TwoXChromosomes,sparecummiesanyone-,Can anybody tell me if these period cramps are normal :// sorry about the long post, 16F and i've always had quite intense period cramps but i thought they were pretty normal for the most part. Recently i brought it up to my friends and they were all pretty concerned and told me they dont experience anything similar, so i'm kind of conflicted.\n\nPretty much i get these very sharp stabbing pains usually in my lower abdomen, from below my bellybutton to like the middle of my pubic area. Theyre extremely painful, and not continuous, but tend to come in waves. Usually there's like a dull ache there too.\n\nSometimes (tmi sorry) they go to like my butthole area instead, like the same area as they were before, but more in the the butt. I find if i put pressure on my stomach where the pains are, the stabbing pains worsen, same with if i make any super fast movements or use the muscles down there. Sometimes even pushing out to pee or poo, or sucking in my stomach sends shooting pains.\n\nThese pains are extremely bad usually a week before my period, and they continue during and afterwards, but not as severe. Here's an example:\n\nJust the other week, i was getting these pains while lying in bed, but since i wasnt moving they werent too bad, so i got up to make myself breakfast. When i was in the kitchen i knelt down to pat my cat, but then the stabbing pains came really hard and i ended up stuck on the floor for like 6 minutes. They were so bad i couldnt move because it'd hurt really bad. It was so painful i was doing that awkward laugh people do when theyre stressed, but even moving from laughing was hurting. Eventually when it died down a bit i forced myself up and went back to my room. I was going to tell my mum but she's very weird about that sort of stuff and by the time she was back home i was alright again. Usually i just deal with it until it goes away.\n\nthank you guys a lott,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/v5b5v2/can_anybody_tell_me_if_these_period_cramps_are/,False"

But, I am able and usually go about my day to day life without thinking about sex or getting super turned on, even for months. I feel like I could be celibate even if there were no external stimuli. \n\nI find him beyond attractive and the sex is amazing. Whenever he touches me in that way or we start something I am always always in the mood for it. \n\nBut I\u2019d really like to be more spontaneous desire, I want to be randomly in the mood so I can act on it! \nI\u2019ve been trying to make a conscious effort to think about it but it\u2019s hard and I forget sometimes.

"atheism,Vintagepoolside,I was researching the missing person\u2019s case of Arianna Fitts, and stumbled across one of \u201cthose\u201d churches.,I\u2019ll try to make this short. \n\nI want to do a podcast about missing minorities. My first place I visited was the FBI\u2019s missing persons. 2 y/o Arianna Fitts was one of the first ones. Her mother, Nicole, was killed and she has been missing since 2016. \n\nAfter some reading around, I found Nicole (her mother) was getting some \u201chelp\u201d from a female street pastor. This woman told Nicole she could stay with her while she got a job and her [the pastor] nieces would babysit Arianna. \n\nThings ended up going sour. Once Nicole started getting paid, the pastor demanded she pay her for letting her stay and having her nieces babysit. She was taking all of Nicole\u2019s checks to the point she wouldn\u2019t be able to get out on her own. The pastor even texted her saying she was not a fit mother and that she should not have Arianna. \n\nOne day when Nicole went to pick up Arianna from babysitting, both her and her daughter went missing. One week later, Nicole\u2019s body was found and Arianna has not been seen since. \n\nThe FBI has not said she is alive, but they have posted Age progression billboards in states related to her disappearance, and the wording they use makes me believe they think she is still alive. She was so small she may not even remember who she is. Now, she would be about 8 years old. \n\nI googled this pastors name. Then I did a Facebook search. The FB search led me to a church. And there were sooo many videos of \u201cpastors\u201d speaking just crazy shit. One was a woman talking about why they don\u2019t celebrate Halloween. She read a children\u2019s book about it, which had completely inaccurate information (the pilgrims and natives became besties and worshipped God together) and literally called it \u201cdumb\u201d when referencing how other cultures thought the dead could come back to life. (Not that I believe that, but still very insensitive to other religions and cultures)\n\nThere was so much more, but it was awfully scary how many people were engaged in this and agreeing. And I get it, Halloween isn\u2019t a big deal, but the WHOLE page was just outlandish ideas and twisted logic. And they had hundreds of followers and seem like a large active church.,https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/v5bexj/i_was_researching_the_missing_persons_case_of/,False"

I just can\u2019t believe my eyes when I see the news.  It\u2019s so heart breaking.  I myself had an abortion before, and I was always pro-choice.  However, that time I was pregnant, it was with my abuser and they were so unhinged, and his mother even talked about \u201ctaking my baby\u201d (they were from east Asia with very few human rights).  I was so freaked out.  They could never take no for an answer and I knew how it would end, especially if I were to try to leave him.  I knew my child couldn\u2019t be born into a safe situation, and I couldn\u2019t do that to him/her.  I said I was pro-choice, but when I fell pregnant, it\u2019s so much different.  I wanted to keep it. I don\u2019t really know how to explain it.  It was one of the hardest and most painful decisions of my life. I\u2019m tearing up as I write this.  I\u2019m sorry.

"atheism,UnfetteredSoul,Where do humans get their morals from? [respone],We've all heard this gotcha question from religious people. If you do not believe in God, where do you get your morals from? Why is rape or murder wrong? This tends to put religious skeptics on defense as it a very valid point. However, it is also valid to say that we get our morals from society/our community.   \n\n\nIt isn't just us. Religious people also try to conform to their best to societies morals.   \n\n\nLet's take the example of Islam. Ask any muslim person, and they'd say they oppose slavery. Yet, just a few centuries ago, slavery was widely adopted and institutionalized in islamic society. The change in perception in viewing slavery wrong came not from religion, but from society advancing. If religious people strictly adopted their morals from scripture, then slavery would still be legal today.   \n\n\nThis raises the question of if religious people are wishy-washy on which morals to stick to, why do they refuse to budge on abortion or homosexuality? It simply comes down to hate.,https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/v5bpk3/where_do_humans_get_their_morals_from_respone/,False"

Does this transfer cost money?,I want to get started in investments, opening both a general account for ETFs and an account for a Roth IRA.  I've been reading as much as I can lately to learn about all the options, etc. - but one technical piece is still not clear to me.  How do you actually transfer money to the investment accounts?  Is it a wire transfer?  Can most investment accounts \"pull\" from my checking account?  Or do I \"push\" it from the checking account?  And does any of this cost money?\n\nFor more personal details:  I have a PNC bank account and a Chase credit card.  It seems I can open a JP Morgan investment account via the Chase account I already have.  Then, can I pay through the Chase credit card and pay that off with the PNC bank already linked?  Or perhaps it would make sense to open a Chase checking / bank account then.\n\nA friend also recommended a Schwab account to get started.

"nosleep,Mr_Pagan665,Ever since I tuned on a radio station, weird things began happening,  \n\nAnother hot Sunday morning. One can feel the sweat forming onto the pillows due to the warm air that keeps slipping through the open window. Its 6 am and it feels as if its already like the middle of the day, it\u2019s probably due to those eyes.  It all comes to them. \n\nI haven\u2019t rested again, in fact I don\u2019t even remember when was the last time I got a nice good rest, ever since these things came my mind has been in constant trial. But now, no one can deny them no one can say otherwise that their existence isn\u2019t there.  \n\nIt all began a month ago; I was working the late night shift at one of our local 24/7 convenient stores. The only convenient thing about it was probably the walking distance back home everything else, felt under some new form of slave ownership. I remember giving the keys to the new guy and while exiting the store I could feel the morning humidity sticking onto my skin. \n\nThe majestic morning twilight was visible to my tired eyes. The contrast from the fluorescent lights of the convenient store to the gradient shades of blue that were painted onto the horizon was always rewarding. One could see the giant orchid yellow stroke that underlined the morning sky signalling the coming of the Sun. The dark shapes of palm trees and towering buildings kept on looming, a paysage, branded to my memory. \n\nI let my cigarettes, un buttoned my work shirt and plugged my earphones and began walking home. As I was listening to my favourite radio station it was briefly intercepted by a white noise that caught me of guard.  The noise was so annoying that I tried immediately to switch stations. The queer thing was however that despite every station I changed the white noise seemed to be persisted. It wasn\u2019t until I finally tuned to a FM station 77.7 which the strange noise suddenly stooped. But there was an emptiness to that station, as no sound was emitted into my ears. \n\nIt felt as if I was listening to nothing, but the eerie sensation that perhaps something was playing in the background bugged me. I took a glimpse at the road before me and I could see my house couple of meters away. I closed my phone and tugged my earphones into my pocket and neglected the whole incident as nothing but a weird radio instance. Perhaps something with their antennas or their broadcasting service.\n\nThe night however was fairly strange, for after the incident weird dreams came forth. Now I don\u2019t remember everything, but what I do remember was one particular scene. I was alone, and before me a vast open field was stretching far as the eye could see. In the distance towering silhouettes of a city loomed. Their dark towers stretching towards the sky, behind them once more the twilight sky was painted, with the very same colour pallet. There was a weird music however, a strange sound was picked by my ears. \n\nThere were constant waves of both high and low pitch frequencies, I could hear distant chiming noises echoing as various vibrations could be felt all around me. There was trance as if I stood alone in this vast emptiness and these weird sounds that surrounded me made the whole landscape before me shift and warp. It felt as if I was part of the Starry night as small orbs began appearing above the city. \n\nThe next thing I remember was waking up covered in my own sweat. The sun rays were slitting though he cracks of the window shutters. I could hear the flapping sound of my almost broken air fan as it violently spans to the maximum setting, but even through I\u2019ve had woken up, I could still hear part of those noises from my dream. They were brief, but they were there just moments before they got consumed by the daily noises of the outside world. \n\nThe rest of the day was more mundane but the nightfall was once more even more strange. For every night since then I would hear the same frequency as I walked back home. It got so annoying that I stopped using my radio. But that was not the even the worst, for each night my dreams became even more wilder and vivid. \n\nThere was one dream that I remember, for I saw that I\u2019ve reached that distant and shadowy town that once stood miles away from me.  The town was desolate, the towering concrete silhouettes were eerie and desolate, one could only hear the wind howling through the empty rooms as it then morphed into a haunting sound as it echoed amidst the ruins. The streets barren, an urban wasteland, for only the physical remains of human creation stood covered in both dust and rumble. But the more one walks deeper into the city of Ruins, the more vibrant and chaotic the sounds become. But the true horror laid beyond the city, in its outskirts, for it Is there where everyone had gone.\n\nI saw pyramid shapes of various sizes towering towards the sky, from the distance one could not distinguish its material. But it was irregular, as if someone piled earth or debris into a conical shape that was stretching upwards. However, it was no earthly material. Thousands of human bodies, some stitched together some stapled while others were tied were piled up into this grotesque pyramid shape.  No other form of expression beyond fear was carved onto their face or at least what\u2019s left of it. One could see that the people who build these pyramids had no particular discrimination, for it was a pure mass of human bodies piled up into one. There were children of various ages, some with decayed limbs while others not, there were elders whose body was starting to decompose, and even women whom seem to be pregnant. Men with missing limbs and even famous politicians could be distinguished.  It was a mass of human bodies nothing more, nothing less.\n\nAs I stood staring at these grotesque pyramids, the chaotic sounds became even more obscure. I could hear as if a calling, strange noises as if a choir of cats mewing all simultaneously, there was a certain relaxation but yet again it felt eerie and disturbing.  I cannot describe the sound for it was beyond anything humanly conceivable, but what I can describe was the terror that loomed over me. A terror that I could finally see. \n\nIn the dark sky above me, the once distant orbs, were now clearly revealed. I saw an enormous eye opening. Its iris was made out of vibrant and flashing colours of various indescribable hues. Its pupil was a hollow and abyssal, as if darker than space. The colours span around it as if consumed by it but what was mostly terrifying was that it looked down at me. I felt so insignificant, like an ant being stared by humans. \n\nIts presence consumed me, it awakened something violent in me, something that made me want to tear down my eyes and rip my head apart, for it had made me mad. Mad because I could not understand it, mad because it felt right, mad because I wanted to reach it. For that\u2019s why moments later I was climbing the pile of bodies, I was climbing the human tower of babel, and I was going to reach it. \n\nIt is here where my dream had ended, but my nightmare had begun. For days I would scroll the internet trying to make some a sense out of this.  In the real world I was an ordinary person, who lived by societies rules, at night fall and in my dreams, I was the only surviving man who was witnessing God himself. There was a primal energy inside that I could only relive into these dreams. I was deemed mad by my close friends, and I distanced myself from them, for only the fiery eye mattered. But then I stumbled upon a forum where it seemed that I wasn\u2019t the only one with similar dreams lately. There were similar cases of other people seeing the very similar dream and some even claimed to stumble also onto that weird FM frequency. I was more than delighted, for now I knew I wasn\u2019t crazy, for I knew perhaps this was a message of some sorts. And perhaps we were the chosen ones. But this didn\u2019t last long, for everything finally changed until may 31st.\n\nFor the past few days before that date my sleep was very fairly calm as the weird dreams or visions had seized. But as the sands of the Sandman had taken me into a deep slumber I was abruptly awoken by the sounds of screams and outer terror from outside my house. I quickly got up thinking it was another vivid nightmare, but it took less than seconds to realize that I was indeed awoke and the screams of a woman were heard outside my house. With shaky hands and trembling fear I opened the shutters only to see that two women began running while screaming at the top of their lungs. It wasn\u2019t long until the screams of two individuals turned into a cacophony of sounds and terror. The whole neighbourhood seemed to be awaken now, as I could see lights being turned on and people opening their doors and coming outside to see what the commotion was. And indeed there was a reason for this commotion, a reason that I would never in a million years would expect. \n\nI stood outside my front step and I stared at the dark blue sky and there it was. The fiery iris once more loomed over me over watching our mortal bodies as they descendent into madness. The black pupil swallowed the stars, and one could see that more eyes began appearing around us. I cannot lie that a smile was carved on my face that night, for now I knew everyone was witnessing their existence. I knew what was to follow, because I felt the very same urge as in my dreams, the urge of understanding it, the urge of reaching it. \n\nAs of writing this, my vision had become a reality, for days now my town has becoming more desolate by the hour. The Piling is about to take place and I must go now. The damn eyes, they are the cause of it. But perhaps I will find peace in all this. Perhaps we all will.,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/v5bwkm/ever_since_i_tuned_on_a_radio_station_weird/,False"

"tifu,Background_Track5059,TIFU by removing a whole server from the network,First of all, I have to say that this story is not new and dates back to early 2021 but it doesn't mean I didn't almost fuck up a whole million dollar corporation by a stupid mistake.\nIt was a normal day at work. The company was the handler of webinars and online events. We weren't remote and minding my home - which is located in a town about 40 km far from the main city - I had to wake up 5 in the morning because I couldn't have any delays on showing up.\nI guess you figured out how toxic the place was, and minding that, I had anxiety issues almost every freaking minutes of working and I could fuck up things at any moment.\nOne day, we had a problem in one of our servers which was responsible for storing data (avatars, videos, posters, etc ). \nI did a SSH connection to the bastion server and checked logs. Everything seemed normal. So I got access to the cloud provider panel and started dissecting the whole node we had.\nI knew we had two servers called \"minio\" and I guessed that having the same name could result some errors in the backend. \nI knew we didn't use one of those, and without paying attention to the specs, I removed the main one.\nA few minutes later, CEO came out of his room and told us - the technical team - that he cannot see the poster of his own webinar.\nWithout telling him the disaster, we told him we're working on the problem. It wasn't were it ended though...\nAfter almost an hour, customers bombarded the support lines with the similar issues.\nThe last thing I remember was that I found out I have written a simple script to take snapshots of the storage server. So I recovered the last snapshot and problem solved.\nIt's more than a year I'm not working there but God, I wish I never go back to those days.\n\nTL;DR: I almost fucked up a whole company by accidentally removing their storage server from a cloud node but I had the tools to recover the damn thing.,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/v5bybk/tifu_by_removing_a_whole_server_from_the_network/,False"

"personalfinance,sourbirthdayprincess,Final paycheck fed tax rate went from 2.7% to 17.5%. How TF?,I was recently terminated from my employer after reporting harassment. I have just received a final payout well beyond what I expected (I thought my pay only went through the day I was fired, and that I had one sick day left) but I am noticing the federal taxes taken out are proportionally WAY higher than usual. \n\nMy usual gross take home for two weeks is $1660.50 and my federal taxes withheld are $45.75 which is 2.7%. For this massive unasked-for lump sum payment of $5996.50 (almost 4x my normal salary) my fed taxes are $1051.76, or 23 TIMES my normal federal tax rate. This means I owed 17.5% of my salary to federal tax payments instead of the usual 2.7%...\n\nMy YTD income is $21K after this payment of nearly $6K. My YTD tax payments are ~$1700 after this $1000 single tax payment. That means for the other $15K of my income I only owe $700 (4.6%), but for this $6K I owe $1000 (17%).

"nosleep,DanielScaryDark,There's a Killer Following Me, and He's Attracted to the smell of Blood.,The first time I had a conversation with the killer was when I was nine years old. I was home when he emerged from my parents room. He was pretty close to my age and said his name was Cain. I asked who he was and he said he was a friend of my parents. According to him, him and my parents were pretty close. \n\nAlthough I liked him, he also scared me. So did the smell that started to waft around the room when I first saw Him. It was like a hospital but it wasn\u2019t a medical smell. It was just the smell of despair. I would later learn that that\u2019s the smell of blood.\n\r\nHe left the room when the smell started to dissipate. Curious I went to my parents room and the sight I found still traumatizes me today. My parents bodies laid lifeless and bleeding on there bed. I screamed so loud the neighbors heard and came running. They called the police and after an investigation. I was sent to an orphanage.\n\r\nCurious enough they asked me questions about how my parents treated me. If they had ever hurt me. I assured them that my parents loved me and never lay a finger on me, the bruises on my body came from just me being clumsy when I played. It was so awful that they were bad mouthing my parents while there bodies lay in a morgue somewhere.\n\r\nThe second time I met Cain, was when I was nineteen. This time he emerged from my girlfriends room in the apartment we shared while we were still in college. I recognized him immediately, although he had also grown. I screamed and shouted that I would kill him for what he did to my parents, not realizing that the smell of fresh blood was once again wafting around the room. Again, like a empty hospital with no one to save the dying person.  \n\r\nHe was confused at my anger and told me he had helped me. He couldn\u2019t bear to hear me scream as my parent hurt me again. However he was insane. My parents had never laid a finger on me.\n\r\nHe left soon after without me ever trying to stop him because I needed to get to my girlfriends room to check on her.\rAgain I found the same sight as I did all those years ago. My girlfriend lying in a pool of blood on her bed. \n\r\nThis time their was a more in depth investigation and the police did a search of the entire city for Cain, from the description I had given. There was no sign of him anywhere.\n\r\nCuriously this time they also questioned me. They had received information that I had an argument with my girlfriend before her death. However there was no such argument. According to the report from a nosy neighbor I had called her a whore and told her I knew about all the guys. \n\r\nThis enraged me and screamed at the detective. I loved her and I would never say those things, my girlfriend was lying in a morgue, how dare they question me like this.\n\r\nThe third time I saw the killer, it was as I was leaving my office for the day. I noticed the smell of blood wafting immediately and pulled out a pair of scissors from my drawer. Like clockwork he emerged from my bosses office. Smiling from cheek to cheek.\n\r\nHe spoke to me again and holding the scissors behind my back I asked him why he kept doing this to me. Knowing full well that my boss was dead in the other room. Again he made it clear that he was helping me. He couldn\u2019t see me being continually hurt by my abusive parents or cheating girlfriend and now he couldn\u2019t stand me being fired by my boss.\n\r\nI briefly thought he was insane, until I realized all my stuff was already packed into a box on my desk. \r\nCain left again, I didn\u2019t stop him but when the police arrived I knew they would be able too. They could pull the footage from the office cameras and start a nation wide search for him.\n\r\nAs I scribble the last part of my statement onto the page in the waiting room, I hear a commotion outside. A large number of officers have gathered outside and there talking quite loudly. Out of the noise I hear the unmistakable words of one officer. \u201cThere was no one else on the tape\u201d.\n\r\nThat of course is impossible because Cain was there. Gripping the paper tightly I cut myself on it and a little bit of blood drips out. \n\r\nThe smell of it wafts around the room and as I look into the mirror I see Cain again.,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/v5c2sc/theres_a_killer_following_me_and_hes_attracted_to/,False"

"tifu,throwaway50000000005,TIFU by letting my curiosity get the better of me and finding out I was sort of catfished.,Posting this on a throwaway because quite frankly it's insanely embarrassing and shameful & I don't really know how to feel.\n\nSo a little while ago I was Twitter mutuals with a girl who used to go by the name Sylence. We were very casual mutuals and never really spoke too often, but the girl in the pictures that were casually posted was somebody that my friend and I used to talk about all of the time because of how pretty she was. \n\nThis girl would routinely disappear from social media and come back on a new account & follow me out of the blue, which we always thought was really weird. Until one day where she just disappeared and never returned, which was over a year or 2 now at this stage (I never really kept track of how often or for how long this happened)\n\nSo my interest today got the better of me. I wanted to know where she disappeared to, but I had no leads other than some pictures of her that were sent to my friend, and some old usernames that led to nowhere. So I reverse searched some of the pictures and found nothing really until one led to a website.\n\nA cumtribute website. Dedicated to girls having their profiles posted out of their knowledge so that people could edit, yep, semen over their faces.  \nI was like what the hell?? How are so many of her pictures posted here? There's more here than I've ever seen before. So then I linked it to my friend who noticed that one of the image files alluded to the girl actually being 16 in the time that the photos were taken, and I'm sitting here like..What. There's no way.  \nI did a little more digging to see if I could find out who was really in the pictures once and for all and after a little more digging I found an Instagram account with a decently sized following, and yup, this girl is only 19. Back when I was mutuals with that person on Twitter it must have been around 2018-2019 or possibly even earlier. The more I looked through the full body of pictures the more obvious it became that this girl was obviously a lot younger than I thought she was, a lot more full body and full faced pictures. I  The person behind the Twitter account was being very selective with what pictures were uploaded and the thought that she could have been younger than even 18 never crossed my mind. \n\nSo I'm not really sure how to feel about the whole situation. A little bit dumb that I indirectly got catfished, a little but dumb that I couldn't tell the person in the pictures was actually a minor, but a little relieved that I actually know who's really in the pictures once and for all. I've considered messaging her and making her aware of the website but honestly there's no good way to approach that kind of conversation because I was admittedly being a little creepy by trying to find her again in the first place, so I think I'd better just leave it and try to forget this ever happened.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR I tried to find an old Twitter mutual who I always thought was extremely pretty and after some digging around I discovered the account was a catfish using stolen pictures from a 16 year old Instagram model & Now I  feel disgusting and stupid.,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/v5c5l1/tifu_by_letting_my_curiosity_get_the_better_of_me/,True"

"DIY,spuffyx,UK BASED: need help understanding regulations for toilets,Hi all!\n\nSo my husband and I have just bought our first house and are DIY-ing a lot of it (with prior experience). In the main bathroom there is currently a toilet, corner shower and sink. \n\nWe are wanting to move the toilet about 2 foot along the wall it is currently on, to create space for a bath. At present, the soil pipe goes out of the back of the toilet, curves 90 degrees and exits the outer wall to the right hand side of the toilet. We just want to move the toilet a couple of foot, so the pipe would still curve the 90 degrees, and would still exit from that same hole in the wall to the right, it would just mean us having an extra couple of foot of soil pipe in the bathroom, which we plan to box in. \n\nThe bath will be added where the shower currently is, and the overhead shower will remain in place. \n\nWhat, if anything, do these alterations need in terms of building notice/regulations/planning etc? I'm really struggling to find much online. We aren't adding any new soil pipes (unless regulations say we need to), we aren't adding new plumbing to the bathroom as it all exists already, we aren't doing anything with electrics, we literally just want to move the toilet a few feet. \n\nIf there is anyone who is up to speed with current regulations and can help break this down for me I'd be so appreciative!

"nosleep,Colt_Leasure,My wife bought me a tombstone for my birthday. It\u2019s for the grave she wants to bury me in.,I\u2019m a camera man for a popular mixed martial arts organization. Any sports fan should be able to guess which company keeps me employed. It\u2019s a great job where my bachelor of arts in film and media studies works to my advantage. The money affords me a comfortable lifestyle. I am paid to have the best view of elite-level hand-to-hand combat. Many would spend a fortune to get an in-person experience of what I see all the time. Hearing the announcer\u2019s voice as he calls out the fighter\u2019s names never ceases to be any less incredible. The downside is the travel requirements. I am often far from my house in California for weeks on end. My contract obliges me to do my job in places like Abu Dhabi and the UK. \n\nWhen I do arrive home after a business trip, there was a tradition my wife had where she gifted me things. Laura always gave me small but meaningful items to signify how much she missed me while I was away. These would be on the table in the living room when I arrived. A single flower plucked from one of her walks or a bottle of wine often awaited me. I tried to convince her to halt her kindness a few times throughout the course of our two and a half years together. I reassured her I did not need material objects to feel cared for. She always insisted anyways.\n\nMy return from an event in New Zealand was when it all began. A fourteen hour plane flight left me exhausted as I walked up the front steps. I pulled out my keys, opened the door, and walked into our home. I passed my dusty black carry bag of golf clubs. Laura stood with a smile on her face a few feet away. A butcher knife was in her right hand. \n\n\u201cHey honey,\u201d I said as I tried to hide my unease at the sight of the stainless steel blade. \u201cWhy do you have that?\u201d \n\nShe gave me a blank look before I pointed at the sharp object she clutched. \n\n\u201cOh silly,\u201d she said. \u201cDid you forget? You filmed the pay-per-view on your birthday. Since you weren\u2019t here to celebrate we\u2019re going to do it now.\u201d\n\nShe took a few steps towards me. I noticed how on one of the counters behind her in the dining area sat a large butterscotch cake. It had caramel stripes and was already cut. Twenty eight lit candles were dipped into the frosting. The baked confection was in the shape of an octagon with crunchy pretzels wrapped around it to form a cage. \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re very kind,\u201d I said. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have to.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course I did. I also got you a present. It\u2019s on the couch. You should open it before we eat.\u201d\n\nI looked over at the surprise she referred to. The physical dimensions of it sent me into a mental whirlwind. I attempted to figure out what it could be. It was twenty four by twelve inches in beige wrapping paper. \n\nI tried to hoist it up. The package was heavy and felt like concrete. For a second I thought she had gotten me some kind of workout equipment for our home gym in the basement.  \n\nI tore the covering apart. Shock coursed through me. \n\nI held a tombstone with my name and date of birth carved into it. The day of my death was blank. It had an epitaph. The quote was from my favorite poet, Robert W. Service: \n\nO*ur breath is brief, and being so, let\u2019s make our heaven here below, and lavish kindness as we go.*\n\nI looked up and stared at my wife. \n\nLaura had a wide smile on her face. Like she expected me to reciprocate her inexplicable positivity over the funereal monument. \n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t be serious,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, my love? You don\u2019t like it?\u201d\n\nI took a long pause and tried to choose my words with careful precision. \u201cWhy did you buy this?\u201d \n\n\u201cEverybody's going to need one. We\u2019re here one second and the next we\u2019re not.\u201d\n\nSome couples do share macabre fascinations. I would never judge them, but that was never us.  \n\n\u201cI find it morbid,\" I said. \"I don\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat opinion can\u2019t hide the reality of the human condition. Now come to the table. Let\u2019s eat.\u201d\n\n\\*\n\nI managed to scarf down a piece of the cake, but for the rest of the night I was sick to my stomach. Jet-lag still plagued me. I did not want to end the evening with arguing. I compartmentalized the event and decided to wait until the next day. When I had some rest to confront her, I decided, I would have a more confident and delicate demand for an answer.\n\nWhen I turned over in bed and saw her slept, she had new books on her night stand. They were all Occultist texts from Aggripa and Crowley.  Authors whose names I recognized but knew very little about. She had never been a spiritual person in any way. *What changed?*\n\nI drifted in and out of night terrors when I slumbered. I never had them before. I tossed, turned, and shivered. \n\nWhen I opened my eyes during a fit of nausea, I saw the headstone. It leaned against the wall of my dresser. The words seemed to stare back at me. \n\nShe had moved it from downstairs after I had passed out. It had to weigh at least two hundred pounds. The physical effort required to get it up the staircase was a sign of intent. \n\nShe wanted it to be the first thing I saw when I awoke. \n\n\\*\n\nMorning came and I went to the kitchen. Laura was there and used our espresso machine. Steam came off of the brew. She poured cold milk into the cups of coffee. \n\nI saw her put a second jug away beneath the sink. It took me a few seconds to register how it was blue. She had done this with such speediness I almost failed to notice it. She stuffed it away in the bottom cupboard. \n\nI sat at the table. She served me a cappuccino and took a seat.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not comfortable with my birthday present yesterday,\u201d I said. \u201cAre you trying to make a veiled threat?\"\n\nShe did not respond. \n\n\"I know I\u2019m not here a lot of the time,\" I continued, \"but I would never cheat on you. You know that. I know you would kill me if I ever did, but that\u2019s not the reason I wouldn\u2019t. I love you and would never hurt you. My absence is a reflection of the financial stability I am building towards. When we do have a child, I want him or her to not want the same things we did when we were younger. I don\u2019t know where your passive-aggressiveness is coming from. I need you to get rid of it or tell me what the issue is so we can move past this like adults.\u201d\n\nShe sipped her coffee. Her eyes seemed to squint at me as though I was someone she had difficulty recognizing. \n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t like the taste?\u201d Laura asked. \u201cI worked so hard in baking it. The ingredients aren\u2019t simple. The design was tough to pull off. I thought it was your favorite flavor. No wonder there are leftovers.\u201d\n\nI slammed my fist down. The java in our containers rippled as two small ponds in an earthquake. \n\n\u201cThis has nothing to do with that,\" I said as I felt my face grow hot. \"I\u2019m talking about the tombstone with my name on it!\u201d\n\n\u201cI was under the impression it would be a good memento,\u201d she said with a smile. \u201cA reminder to never take things for granted.\u201d \n\nI leaned back in my chair and rubbed my temples. Her trying to sugar coat it as an innocent act only enraged me further. \n\n\u201cWhy are you so happy now?\u201d I asked. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen you so at peace before. I make enough money to help you quit your job and never work for that terrible firm again. Your demeanor wasn\u2019t even this bright on the day I told you you\u2019d never have to go back to that cesspool. I\u2019m trying to figure out why you\u2019re angry at me and handed me the world\u2019s most condescending present. All you do in return is talk about the fleeting nature of existence. You\u2019ve changed. What happened when I was away?\u201d\n\n\u201cLife is wonderful. We need to make the most of the time we have here.\u201d\n\nSomeone knocked. \n\nShe stood, walked over and gazed through the peephole. It was the postman. He delivered a package and strolled back to his truck when she went out on the porch. \n\nAs she bent down to grab the parcel, I went to the sink and swung open the bottom door. \n\nA bottle of Zerex brand anti-freeze was there. Its cap was loose. A few ounces of its contents had been emptied. \n\nI dumped the coffee in the trash bin by our refrigerator and felt beads of sweat form across my forehead. \n\n*This came from the garage. It has no place in the dining room. Why would she need it while making espresso?* \n\nThe answer was obvious, but there has never been anything harder for me to accept.\n\n*Laura is poisoning me.* \n\nI went up to the bedroom and locked the door. I stared out the window at our suburban street. She talked with a neighbor about the sunny weather while I paced back and forth. \n\nI was foolish to do so in the moment, but I thought of all the good times we had together. Our first date at Lake Topaz with a bottle of Pinot Noir. Our vacation in the Caribbean on a luxury cruise ship. The after-parties she had attended with me surrounded by athletes and media moguls. \n\nI had done my best to spoil and provide a good life for her in any way I could. \n\nHer way of repaying me was to try and take my life insurance. \n\nMy value was not enough to her alive. The healthy payout after my murder was what she was after. The reality of that harsh truth burned every fiber of my being. \n\nWith her background in law, I knew she could manipulate the system to her advantage after I was dead. She would stage the scene so a toxicology report would not even be looked into. \n\nI reached into my pocket, unlocked my phone and dialed 911.\n\n\u201cWhat is the location of your emergency?\u201d\n\nI gave the operator my address. My speech patterns were so broken from a combination of nerves and rage that she had to think I was drunk. \n\nShe asked for a callback number. I gave it through gritted teeth as I felt my palms dampen with the device pressed against my slick skin. \n\n\u201cTell me exactly what happened.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy wife is trying to murder me. She\u2019s putting coolant in her cooking and drinks. She\u2019s serving them to me believing I won\u2019t notice.\u201d\n\n\u201cSir, I need you to speak slower.\u201d\n\nI looked out the window again.\n\nShe was no longer there. \n\nFootsteps came up the stairs.\n\n\u201cSend somebody right away,\u201d I said. \n\n\u201cHoney,\u201d Laura called out, \u201cwho are you talking to? Should I expect a guest?\u201d\n\nShe shook the knob and tried to enter. \n\nI stayed on the line. The dispatcher continued to ask me a variety of questions. Her emergency inquiries lost all coherence as my stress-level rose. \n\nLaura banged her fist even harder on the other side. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m calling the cops,\u201d I said with so much ire I felt all my blood rise. \u201cI know what you\u2019re doing to me. This stops here.\u201d\n\nA loud bang filled my ears. The center of the door was torn apart. It disintegrated and revealed the outline of my wife\u2019s body as she used a golf club to barrel her way in. A hail of splintered drywall hit the carpet with each swing.  \n\nLaura charged at me with the iron lob wedge raised above her. I tried to sidestep her strike. The end of it grazed my ear and left me dazed. \n\nI grabbed the middle and heaved my weight against her until we tumbled down the stairs. \n\nOnce I had disarmed her at the base of the first step, she scratched at me with her nails.  Several marks formed below my eyes. The painful burning sensation of the wounds left my vision blurry.  \n\nI did something I swore I never would. I raised a hand not only to a woman, but the one I walked down the aisle with a few short years before. When my flat bottom part of my palm connected with her nose, I thought the fight was over.\n\nShe kicked up and her heel caught my eye. I stumbled in reverse and the back of my head hit the wall. I blacked out.\n\n\\*\n\nWhen I came to, I recognized how she had dragged me into the basement. She stood over me with her wedding dress folded over her arms and a butane torch in her right hand. \n\nTo my left I saw the jug of anti-freeze and a thermos with its top screwed off. I gazed at the ceiling. Laura had disabled our smoke detectors. She laughed as she lit the bridal gown on fire.\n\n\u201cI was never happy being with you,\u201d she said as she stomped out the last of the flames on the dirt flooring.\n\nPolice sirens rang out in the distance as I stood and drove my shoulder into her already battered face. She screamed at me as I got on top of her and pinned her to the ground.\n\nLaw enforcement entered with guns drawn. She yelled at them with a bloodcurdling screech and resisted. Two of the officers threw her to the ground and placed her in custody.\n\n\\*\n\nI have remained single since that time. I now have a lifelong distrust of any potential romantic partner. I felt idiotic for not seeing any red flags thrown up by her in the past. What she did to me has made me question my own instincts when it comes to reading people.\n\nI had a licensed process server deliver her our divorce paperwork. I was not eager to meet her in Mira Loma prison. I am still not entitled to an immediate legal separation without formal proceedings. This angers me. I am not going to risk her getting any assets though, in this life or the next. \n\nI went to the hospital to get a handle on the physical damage her poisoning had done. Their results did show some harm. They administered treatment on me in the form of a wonder drug called Antizol.  I was lucky. It prevented permanent organ damage within the right amount of time. \n\nShortly after the events, I hocked my wedding ring at a pawnshop and used it for repairs around the home.\n\nAs I write this post, I stare at that tombstone. It sits by my computer desk. I like how the moon\u2019s luminescence glints off of it when I cannot fall asleep, which is more often than not the case. \n\nI\u2019m going to keep it, since her statement was not wrong. I will need it one day.   \n\nEND,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/v5c6pk/my_wife_bought_me_a_tombstone_for_my_birthday_its/,False"

"personalfinance,atlastgold,How To Build and Protect Your Wealth With Gold & Silver,Gold and silver have long been thought of as a safe haven for investors. But with the recent economic downturn, many people are wondering if they can still afford to invest in precious metals. Here are some tips on how to build and protect your wealth without breaking the bank.\n\n### The benefits of investing in gold and silver\n\nGold and silver have long been considered valuable assets. In fact, gold was once used as currency. Today, gold and silver are still highly valued commodities and make excellent investments. Here are some reasons why you should consider investing in gold and silver, even if you're on a budget: -Gold is rarer than silver, which makes it more valuable. -Gold is resistant to corrosion and does not tarnish over time. - Silver is a good conductor of electricity and heat, which makes it useful in a variety of industries.\n\n### How to affordably invest in precious metals\n\nPrecious metals have become an increasingly popular investment in recent years. While gold and silver have always been valued for their beauty and rarity, today they are also seen as a way to protect one's wealth. Many investors view precious metals as safe-haven assets, which can provide stability during times of economic uncertainty. If you're interested in investing in gold or silver but don't have a large budget, there are still several options available to you. One option is to purchase coins or bars from a reputable dealer.,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/v5c6yh/how_to_build_and_protect_your_wealth_with_gold/,False"

"TwoXChromosomes,Phenoptik,When I came across a post that asked this question by a deleted user. XX Tribute.,Repost from a dead thread. Felt it actually has more value here.\n\nWhen I came across a post that asked this question by a deleted user.\n\nI feel like, as a woman ,my only success is how attractive I can be in dating and in life. My question is stupid, but is this just a stereotype placed on women by society?\n\nI responded with great delight, assuming this person was actually curious. \n\nThis is an excellent inquisitive expression! This is not stupid by any means. It opens up into the core being of how female humans have come to be. I think you would find that Evolutionary science might be a formidable friend in this inquiry. More accurately, the evolutionary theory of mate selection.\n\nThese are theories, albeit the most accurate we have to the truth for our species, nonetheless, suppositions of ideas intended to explain principles of the dynamics that are derived from Human evolutionary evidence of physical and behavioral ancestors from over a period of six million years.\n\nThe basic principle is that the preferred mate choices and attendant social cognitions and behaviors of both women and men, and those of other species, have evolved to focus on and exploit the reproductive potential and reproductive investment of members of the opposite sex.\n\nSexual selection is a biological way one sex chooses a mate for the best reproductive success. Most compete with others of the same sex for the best mate to contribute their genome for future generations. This has shaped human evolution for many years, but reasons why humans choose their mates are not fully understood.\n\nWomen tend to be more selective than men when deciding romantic partners. Though scientists have long chalked up women's pickiness to evolution, new research says the explanation may be simpler. Men typically approach women first, and the act of approaching increases desire.\n\nFemale mate choice is a dynamic process that allows individuals to selectively mate with those of the opposite sex that display a preferred set of traits.\n\nWhy are females typically more selective than males in selecting a mate?\n\nEggs are precious. Say it with me, My Eggs are precious.\n\nThat makes eggs far rarer than sperm. In fact, more sperm cells are released during a single ejaculation than a woman produces her entire life. Maybe that's one reason why eggs are worth so much more than sperm. Thus, females may be more selective because they have more invested in each gamete and in the resulting offspring. Due to the availability of eggs, this is considered a limiting factor in reproductive success, rare and valued. Therefore, males tend to compete for female attention and not vice versa.\n\nPast research has demonstrated clear gender differences in reported mate selection criteria. Compared to women, men place more importance on physical attractiveness and women place more importance than men do on the earning capacity of a potential mate. These gender differences have been explained using both socio-biological propositions and differences in the relative economic power of men and women.\n\nHumans, in short, are neither solely monogamous, nor solely promiscuous; neither polygamous nor polyandrous. Which strategies from the particular person chooses is heavily dependent on all circumstances.\n\nTherefore, know your worth, no matter what you think the imaginary attractive rating is floating above your head as you live through the milestones of your femininity.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYours Truly,\n\nXX,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/v5c8gi/when_i_came_across_a_post_that_asked_this/,False"

"nosleep,kar3488,I lived with Ghost for two years.,15 years ago, I was fresh out of high school. I was working at a grocery store part time while contemplating my next move (I eventually ended up deciding to go to college). When I was a freshman   in college I lived off campus in an older, affordable, apartment complex. This was on the outskirts of town closer to the highway. Most of my neighbors were older, retired, folks. But there also several college students in similar situations to myself. That situation being, working just to make rent, and depending on that sweet sweet financial aide. The apartment complex was built in the late 1970s, this was evidenced by the dated decorations and cheesy wallpaper on the inside. \n\n   The first couple months of me living in this complex was fairly normal. Nothing odd happened, the lone exception being the cops being called one evening due to a heated domestic dispute on the ground level of the building across from mine. As time progressed I started noticing odd things around my apartment. Keys or small items would be moved from where I placed them. More than once I would  come home to the fridge door wide open. These things at first didn't register as something really strange, just wrote it off as me being forgetful. I should also state that I didn't have a roommate at this time. As that first fall turned in winter, the activity really picked up. One evening in early November, I was getting ready to out and eat, when I heard a huge crash come from my bedroom (now up until this point nothing weird had ever happened there) I walked into the room and my computer monitor had fallen off the desk an a drawer on the same desk was open.\n\nThis freaked me a bit, so I turned on all the lights in the bedroom on and left the little hall light on before I left. I came back later that night and walked inside at first nothing registered as off or weird, but then I remembered I had left the lights on, and it was now dark except for the spare bedroom light, which I had not cut on. The layout of the apartment was as follows: Walk into the living room, small wall divides that into a kitchen area on the right, straight ahead from the living room is a small hall way with a small spare room on the left and bathroom on right with the master bedroom at the end of the hallway. I quickly turned on the living room light  (and the TV for noise) and walked over to the guest room and went inside. The light was on, and except for a small desk on side of the room, it was empty. I realized as I walked into the room the closet door was slid back (it was empty) but on the desk was a bunch of spare change that was arranged in a sort of wavy line pattern. \n\nI was thoroughly spooked by this but I was locked into rent until May so I had to make due. Nothing else happened until the week after exams and week before I went home for Christmas. One night I had a lady friend spending the night, a girl I had met in one of my design classes, as we were chilling in bed. I remember she got up to use the bathroom and I had turned around to face the wall. I heard her walk back into room and get back into bed, I turned around to talk to her, but there was no one there, just the indentation where it looked like someone was laying. I was utterly stunned and I could fell the hair on my arms stand up. Then after what felt like an eternity, indentation slowly popped back up and the room felt \"normal\" again. My friend returned to bed and never mentioned anything out the ordinary, and I never said a word to her about it.\n\nAfter this last experience I was thoroughly spooked. I closed up my apartment or the winter break and went home for two weeks. When I came back there was nothing out of the ordinary, everything was how I left it. This lasted for about three weeks. Then in mid January shit started up again. I had started dating the girl that was mentioned above. She would stay over with me a few nights a week and I would stay with her a few nights. One evening I was working and she was at my apartment, when she called me and told me that as she was pulling into the parking lot and saw an older lady staring out of my guest room window. She asked if I had a relative visiting or if my mom was in town. I assured her neither was the case. She got freaked out and went back to her place and after work I drove to her apartment and we went back to my place together. The door was locked and when we entered nothing at all was out of place.\n\nTo say we were both frightened at this point was an understatement. My girlfriend refused to stay over for a solid month. She was convinced the place was haunted, and I was starting to think she might be right. I decided to ask around some of the older neighbors to see if anyone had maybe died in the house. The lady that had lived here the longest had been there roughly thirteen years. In that time she stated that to her knowledge nothing odd had happened or no one had died in that apartment since she lived there. The property owners got wind I was asking around about deaths in their complex, and spoke to me about not doing those things as it could be considered defamation and legal action could be taken. I cooled it out of fear of getting into trouble.\n\n   Things happened on a regular basis. These included objects still moving, lights turning on and off, one other nightly visitor to my bed (this happened in the summer of my first year) and friend who had come to visit saying someone knocked on the bathroom door while he was showering and I was out. Finally the spring of my sophomore year shed some light on my mystery! One of the maintenance men who managed the properties, caught me coming back from class one day and asked if he could talk to me. He told me that in 1987 a lady who lived alone in my apartment had died of natural causes. This was was the middle of the month so the rent was paid, he stated that the reason it was kept hush hush is because it her body hadn't been discovered for about 7 or 8 days, and the only reason anyone took the time check on her was because the smell of \"rotting meat\" that started to faintly drift out of apartment. (I want to mention that this took place in Georgia, in the American south, where it stays warm and gets incredibly hot in the summers. I can only imagine how quickly a body could decompose and how STANKY that finding this lady had to be!).\n\n  He told me he was 15 at the time and it was a huge deal. He suspected the owners didn't mention it because they were afraid it would scare people off. He told me that while he was working there that he had never encountered anything odd, but rarely had to go to that apartment. He had been working on the property for about 8 years at this point. He did mention that apartment (apartment I) did seem to only keep tenants for one contract term at a time. I stayed in that apartment until he fall of 2012, my last semester, when I finally moved into a smaller efficiency apartment. The whole time I lived in apartment I, with the exception of the first two months my freshman year, odd things happened. Although I never saw the ghost I had several interactions with it. This has made me a firm believer in the supernatural.,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/v5c8t7/i_lived_with_ghost_for_two_years/,False"

Alter reality. How unfair is that? That it doesn\u2019t matter what we truly are; that it doesn\u2019t matter what the truth is. All it mattered was what people were saying.\n\nOkay. I\u2019ll concede. Perhaps my father was right. Perhaps some words were indeed just words. Some words you find it easier get used to, simply because they hurt just a little less than others.\n\n\u201cFat.\u201d \u201cUgly.\u201d \u201cStupid.\u201d\n\nFine.\n\nBut then there was that incident in school, where I\u2019d accidentally bumped into a female student on my way to class. A reflex smile, uncertain, and a hand laid on her shoulder to stop her from falling into the lockers. Her jumping back, eyes wild, fingers pointing.\n\n\u201cPervert!\u201d\n\nThere are some words that create waves so high you wish you would drown for real.\n\nWords travelled, fast. I quickly went from the fat, ugly, stupid guy to the pervert. There were many other things, each crueler and harsher than the last, but this story isn\u2019t about that. This story was about how some words aren\u2019t just words, so let\u2019s stay on track.\n\nI told my father what had happened, on the same day, and the days after. I\u2019d looked to him for help and advice; I needed what a child would need from a parent - the right words. If you\u2019d been paying attention, you\u2019ll know it didn\u2019t quite work out.\n\nWhen the other kids started shoving me into lockers, pouring my belongings into toilets, throwing small bricks into my room window wrapped in pieces of cloth labelled \u201cpervert! slut!\u201d on them, I learned that some words weren\u2019t just words. They were action.\n\nIt intrigued me.\n\nYou see, I never knew the power of words. As a boy, living alone with my father, I was taught about the power of silence. Of keeping quiet. Saying nothing.\n\nI went to the police station the day after the bricks fell. But it wasn\u2019t about the shoving, or the pouring, or the throwing. I\u2019m sorry if you thought it was about that. This story is about an entirely different word.\n\nMy father was arrested that same night. I sat with the policemen all night, answering questions. Many questions, all about one single word.\n\n\u201cPaedophile.\u201d\n\nThere are some words that create waves so high you wish you would drown for real.\n\nI\u2019d been drowning for about five years.\n\nThings happened quickly after that. But this story isn\u2019t about that. Like I said, this story is about words.\n\nI\u2019m not sure if I\u2019ll ever see my father again. Or if I want to. But if I ever do, I know what I\u2019ll say to him.\n\nThat some words aren\u2019t just words.\n\nSome words are action.,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/v5cbqu/some_words_arent_just_words/,True"

"atheism,Verra_ty,On the verge of a collective awakening,In times of crisis, human awakens. More than ever, the crises coming from the outer and inner world bring us back to a deep introspection. History is leading us to a collective awakening, in which the highest potential of the human being can be reached.\n\nPeople are mad because they live in their head, instead of surrendering to the eternal Now, to the full awareness of what is. Moment to moment, we have the possibility to be present in what is. But we are fooled by the only alternative: thoughts. Our mind has been fooling us all along. If a man in the street is perceived to be constantly talking out loud, he will be perceived as crazy. I have a question for you. Is that person not less crazy than the person who is constantly thinking? The difference is that one is more quiet than the other. Man is also in love with madness because he wants to change the world without questioning his perception of the world. This is the ultimate fact of our world today. People are consumed by permanent dissatisfaction because their desires are not satisfied. Like a 10 year old child, they demand the materialization of their thoughts, beliefs, religions and preferences in the material world. Life is moving. Trying to change life is like trying to empty the ocean of water with a bucket. It is lost in advance.. The only thing that is permanent in our subjective reality is the awareness of what is. To live in our thoughts is to live in the movie of the consciousness of what is. It is living in the movie of the present. It is living the movie of your life instead of actually living it. It is living in a mental prison that prevents us from admiring the spectacle of life moment to moment. Surrendering to the present moment and therefore to the total unknown is the solution.\n\nWar, relationship problems, individualism and dehumanization are in vogue these days. All this is the result of an identification with our mind, our thoughts, our past and our future, our image in society. In short, to the constellation of thoughts that we think we are. This is the ego. It is only an illusion. There is only the eternal present moment, free of all mental suffering. De-identifying ourselves from our ego, allows us to reach a state of equanimity and inner peace. This clarity of Being allows us to reach our highest potential as human beings. Indeed, when an awakened human being performs an activity, the masterpiece appears. Because he is purified of all parasitic thoughts and emotions hindering his final decision or activity. Because he loses himself in the activity, to the point of becoming the activity. The doer is gone. As our life is a sum of activities. So, by waking up, we become life. Or rather, we realize that we have always been Life. We are Joy, unconditional Love that is filled with altruism. We only have to remember the little 6 month old child we were, filled with love, intuition, pure of all thoughts and anchored in the present moment. By realizing the self, we remove the veils of illusion, which then allows us to see more clearly.\n\nFor the moment, I sincerely think that at birth, a baby seems closer to the meaning of life than an adult . It seems that at the end of his life, Man finds a certain wisdom born of the chaos of his experiences. So from Plato to nowadays, I would say that humanity is at the end of its thirties. It won't be long before it becomes wiser. If I am optimistic, in a few centuries.,https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/v5cd6t/on_the_verge_of_a_collective_awakening/,False"

I read it at least 5 years ago and remember being absolutely blown away by the big reveal, but I was like 15 at the time, so I was curious to see if I would enjoy the author\u2019s style now that I\u2019m older. I must admit I found Family of Liars a little underwhelming. Having loved the twist at the end of We Were Liars, I expected something similar, but the big twist in this one kind of fell flat. Maybe because I didn\u2019t care about the person >!who died. I thought the only complex characters were the three sisters, everybody else was really one-dimensional, especially Pfeff.!< There was some good writing, and unlike a lot of people, I didn\u2019t mind the fractured prose or the fairytales. My problem was more with the fact that whenever something terrible happened, it was kinda glossed over and happened really quickly, like when >!her little sister Rosemary died. Like we didn\u2019t get to read about her finding out, about the funeral etc. and it didn\u2019t help that it happened so early in the novel, so there was little emotional impact.!< Has anybody read this book shortly after reading We Were Liars? What did you think about the two in comparison?

"TwoXChromosomes,NoMagiciansAllowed,Men are not fucking safe,I'm happily married to a man who is beyond what I'd ever expect a man to be. Good, loyal, honest and true. I've had very bad experiences with men in the past, but his family and brothers were always what I considered good people.\n\nLast night I had a truly alarming (and casual) conversation with one of his brothers-- someone I've known for almost a decade. My BiL also has a young daughter and is what I'd consider a very active and good father. Conversation turned to one of his buddies who he no longer talks to because he tried to use my BiL as a cover for cheating on his wife (buddy texts him saying \"hey if my wife asks where I was, tell her you were with me). It didn't float with my BiL and he cut contact.\n\nThen he goes on to tell me the buddy was then discovered to be dating a 15 year old. I was clearly shocked and he started sort of internally debating if he'd ever talk to his friend again. I said... well obviously not, he's a rapist. When I tell you I was shook to my core that my BiL started making excuses for a rapist saying \"oh no it wasn't like that, the 15 year old wanted to be with him\". I was beyond speechless. I kept insisting it was rape, but then the convo was interrupted and changed.\n\nMen are not fucking safe and they have no clue what women go through on a daily basis. They don't fucking know and they don't fucking care what it takes to grow up as a young woman with predators and men who will demean and belittle your entire existence.,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/v5cjz4/men_are_not_fucking_safe/,False"
"personalfinance,ptanaka,Small windfall & we have few debts. Should we pay off house? ($32k),I came into $150k & will likely come into more (additional $75k) in the coming months.\n\nOur financial situation in a nutshell: \nHusband is 70, retired, has small savings he draws a minimum off of monthly. ($250k, and draws $500 a month) Additionally he gets SS check plus a small pension and VA injury related check. Let's say on a fixed income, he's at $2500 a month, after taxes. \n\nI am 65, and have a great job that I plan to rock until I drop. It's creative, challenging and yet stress free due to chill colleagues. I don't make lots, but we make do. **After** taxes I bring home $3200 a month. Before tax contributions go to my pension (work for gov. ). I have about $200k in my savings portfolio. Not much, but I plan to reinforce with my windfalls.\n\nWe both have emergency funds. About $10k each, and that was before the windfall. \n\nWe have paid up cars, no credit card debt and we will on the frugal side not by choice... There's just not much to do where we live and spouse is really freaked by Covid and the idiots that live here that don't wear masks (and die. Go figure!) so we don't go Anywhere. \n\nWe owe $32k on the house. Our monthly Note is $950. We always pay $1100...\n\nI figure with this $150k, plus a small amount more to come, pay off the house makes sense. \n\nMy brother said to not pay it off because of interest write offs. What I explained to him is that we don't get to itemize: As a couple filing jointly, we've not been able to write stuff off! And with only $32k left, we are paying more principle then interest.\n\nHe's insistent we should refi and take out new mortgage to include household updates and repairs. \n\nI'm thinking to pay off house note. And we put some of the left over funds in a money market for those big ticket household emergencies such as new roof, hvac unit, well & septic (country living, sigh). It's a 20 year old house rocking the same appliances, roof tiles, ac unit, windows, etc..\n\nWould love some input on what I might be missing based on my older brother's recommendations...,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/v5ck6a/small_windfall_we_have_few_debts_should_we_pay/,False"

Right as he got on top, I exploded my load like there was no tomorrow. I felt as though if a thousand anime bitches were infront of me, even tho it was my fat friend, jeremy. My parents came in to check on us, while I was exploding my load and my balls were turning back to white (they were blue for hours). AITA? What should I do? My parents are sending me to rehab (Ive been addicted to Percocet's for a while, and did this while I was high). Please help, whenever I come downstairs my parents look at me in disgust, when I look at the mirror I cant help but relive the memory of what happened. Should I ask him out and do it again?

But soon after I stopped caring.\n\nBut now that I recently moved into adulthood, I stated thinking that again, \"what if someone robs and murder me? will I go to hell cause I don't believe in God?\", it doesn't help that I am a really anxious and easily scared person either, and I can't even afford a mental health professional, I've already asked my parents for an appointment too and the response was: \"You should stop asking us for unnecessary things and go find a job\".

"gaming,golden1118,Cheaters in so many games today,I'm an older gamer (37) and back when I was a kid and growing up playing games nonstop if you got caught cheating in a game, you would receive an i.p. ban. It's sad how now days in many competitive games people are cheating, using hacks, smurfing and everything else under the sun and nothing is done. They need to bring back i.p. bans, if you got an i.p. ban back in that day it would block all consoles and devices from getting on that game from that i.p. address and it would stop people from cheating instantly because the punishment was beyond harsh, they wouldn't let you even play. Tired of playing games like RL, Siege, CSGO, and many others and it's just people hacking or smurfing. Bring back the bans and put a stop to this shit. These companies are so greedy now though they won't full on ban people because they might lose a few bucks, very sad and disgusting, you're killing gaming.,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/v5d11w/cheaters_in_so_many_games_today/,False"

"movies,Boss452,I really appreciate the warmth and sincerity of the Harry Potter movies.,Recently watched a few Potter movies in a row and there is something about these films, as well as Lord of the Rings for that matter, that connect with you on a deeper level than most blockbusters.\n\nIn Potter, there is a lot of emotional storytelling. themes of the strength of family bonds, value of friendship in darker times, loss of close loved ones, kindness, generosity & sacrifice are all well portrayed. But more than that, emotion is allowed to play on for long rather than be suppressed or be undercut immediately by a joke. \n\nDeaths stand rather than resurrections happening every other movie. Characters are allowed to experience different emotions rather than remain one note. The friendships between the trio are wonderfully played out.\n\nA lot of the credit has to go to JK Rowling whose books lay the foundation. But I'm glad that the filmmakers chose to bring in those aspects of the books to screen too. Yes, they did start to focus on action over the mundane, contemplative moments as the films progressed, but these movies always had heart.\n\nIn fact Deathly Hallows Parts 1 and 2 have some great emotional storytelling.\n\nI think the Potter movies will continue to resonate with people as time goes on despite some turbulent times around the franchise presently because they have a lot of emotional sincerity to them.,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/v5d1pe/i_really_appreciate_the_warmth_and_sincerity_of/,False"

"tifu,Liliana_ana,TIFU by cutting my bangs,Typical story, cut my bangs, turns out ugly blah blah blah. But I still want to rant about it. (**Very** dramatic)\n\nAnyway, a couple years ago, I decided I wanted bangs. Mostly because I kept thinking about this certain hairstyle that I saw. So y'know, I cut it myself to a length that would look cute untucked but still be tuckable in case it turns ugly. It's basically curtain bangs but less noticeable and requires less maintenance. Looks... not the best but still okay, does the job of bringing more flair to my round face.\n\nEventually they grew past around my shoulders so it was time to cut it. The first time, it turned out okay. Came out better than the first attempt. Then today, I realized that I would be around some more people. While I don't usually like the spotlight, I didn't want to fall to the background. Decided today was hair trimming day. \n\nPreviously, I finally gained the courage to offhandedly mention that I was interested in bangs to my mother, and when we went to cut our hair she asked the hair stylist to give me side bangs. It wasn't noticeable, in fact, it kind of looked like my actual bangs that I did myself. But it was on the wrong part, so one bang??? was longer than the other. \n\nFast forward to today, the one thing I needed to do while cutting my hair was even it out. The scissors I was gonna use was outside, so I went to get. I was impatient and cut my hair without a mirror. Wrong move. Just by seeing the pieces of hair that I cut, I already knew it was uneven. It's hard to explain. I went into  my room that has a mirror and tried doing the other bang. It turned out better than the other but if you looked at both of them, then you can tell they are not straight. \n\nDidn't know what to do, put the scissors back, and try to see what I can do to salvage my hair. With my hair down, you can tuck my bangs behind my ears and nothing looks strange, but if you put it up like in a ponytail, only one can get tucked in. It's just a small thing but omg it annoys me. It'll be fine by the time schools comes back and I guess I look better with my hair down anyway...\n\nTL;DR Cut my own hair and now it looks worse,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/v5d24f/tifu_by_cutting_my_bangs/,False"

So I only heard Turning Japanese, Big in Japan, Tokyo Rose, Japanese Boy and there's other songs about Japan that I never heard if they mention of Nippon or Japan with an English country, okay, here's why I'm asking this, because I just discovered this shocking songs saying Japan or Nippon with this latina country I never have expect that, okay I wonder will you think you'd be ready to be pitter-patter or your heart is pounding becoming embarrassed and shocked by that after you finish reading the second paragraph and watch these small snippet of clips, sorry for my bad English native levels, because of ridiculous learning problems when I was a kid as I never spoke very well then, but I hope you commenters would understand this as best I could tell you this!\n\nHere I present you Japan/Nippon & with this country you never think this shouldn't have exist right?

"gaming,Bismarck_98,Why I hate Ubisoft games and the current state of media in general,I don\u2019t have any friends that play SP games so I have to vent here. Please don\u2019t automatically dislike and move on. Share your thoughts.\n\n~10 years ago during the PS3/X360 era Ubisoft were at the top of the world. Their games were bigger and dare I say better than any other studio overall. Even if you liked the writing of Mass Effect, the stealth in Splinter Cell, the combat of God Of War etc more you couldn\u2019t get a combination of these attributes pretty much anywhere else. And since they were still new themselves to their open world formula you saw a lot of slow burn opening hours and attention to detail that is now just skipped entirely.\n\nThere were a lot of issues and shortcuts that we just couldn\u2019t detect at the time. Why do people in AC2 talk in a weird mixture of English and Italian? Why are there so many icons on my map leading me to treasure chests and even garbage? Why does it seem like the playable characters can kill each and every single person on the planet when I am controlling him, but during cutscenes it\u2019s like we are in an entirely different universe in which we can get hurt by one guy and the life of individual people appears significantly more important? Oh we are in Italy so of course we get to meet Leonardo Da Vinci, why does this world feel so dead and lifeless etc etc\n\nAnd 2 console generations later\u2026 it\u2019s all the same. Ubisoft have made 0 efforts to make their games immersive or more fun to play. Just bigger maps, more content, more contrived, predictable, clich\u00e9d storytelling and more lazy dialogue mixing accents and languages. \n\nWait what am I talking about? Nowadays the situation is worse! If your enemy is higher level than you he can take more bullets to the brain before dying, there are numbers ripped straight out of borderlands showing up every time you land a hit killing the already nonexistent immersion, there is more obnoxious UI than ever before, every quest requires you to travel more and more meters because the boring and lifeless map is bigger than ever before, the gameplay loop and quest design haven\u2019t been modified ONE BIT since AC2 and Far Cry3 and the time savers. No game should ever offer or need time savers. \n\nUbisoft represents everything wrong with modern media. Quantity to the point of no quality.,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/v5d3a1/why_i_hate_ubisoft_games_and_the_current_state_of/,False"

"personalfinance,thowawaytheavocado,Parent just died with lots of debt. I am trustee and sole beneficiary. Currently overseas and lost on what to do. I've already had enough.,Feel like I'm in over my head. Parent just died while I'm overseas and I'm unable to return for a few months. We were estranged so emotionally I'm only stressing about dealing with the estate. I've paid out of pocket to cover the cremation and death certificates. Parent had already prepaid for their ashes to be buried so there's no funeral or burial costs. \n\nI found a trust and it seems they left everything to me - I'm beneficary on life insurance and everything  else it seems. I've already made phone calls to the life insurance companies that I found and am in the process of getting the payout (just need to send death certificates). I also used the NAIC locator to see if there's any other policies they may have had. \n\nLooks like they set up a trust with their house (paid off) in it. The trust also mentions vehicles (they owned one and it's paid off) and other personal property. \n\nI've contacted the attorney who wrote the trust and they pulled out their copy of the trust and read through it. They got back to me and advised that I start locating all the assets while they look into the trust (I think they mentioned looking into the house specifically). Before they go any further they want a me to sign an Attorney-Client fee contract that outlines their hourly fees. They also need me to pay a retainer. \n\nI've already made calls to banks and pension providers - they say they are sending me more info but can't do anything until I receive the death certificates and send them over a copy. Again, I should be the beneficiary on all this. \n\nI've made some calls to the hospitals I know they have outstanding bills from just to inform them that my parent had died. All of them are requesting I call them back to discuss what financial options are available to me. \n\nI have access to my parent's online accounts/passwords/email etc. They have money in the bank but also loads of bills. Probably more medical bills than money in the bank. Should I even be looking through all this? \n\nMy questions:\n\n1. I myself paid out of pocket for the cremation. Can I be paid back from this from the estate, even if the medical bills are over the amount of assets? I really couldn't afford to pay this in the first place, but felt I needed to do it. \n2. I can't afford to pay an attorney, not even the retainer. Again, can this be billed to the estate? Essentially I refuse to pay another cent of my own money on this when I can see a substantial amount of money in my parent's checking account. Simply put, I can't afford to anyways. \n3. If I'm listed as the beneciary on all the assets, what would happen if I just walked away from all this and stopped making phone calls? A huge part of me just wants to collect the life insurance and walk away. I keep hearing the word 'probate' thrown around. If I understand this correctly, would a creditor (say, a hopsital that my parent owed a huge bill to) open up probate with the County and get paid that way? How would they access my parent's accounts to pay off the bills? What if there's not enough in the accounts to pay them off? What would they sell next - the house? How does this happen? If there's any money or other assets left over after all bills are paid, how would they get them to me?\n4. Feel like I already know the answer to this one, but should I even be calling any of the businesses my parent owes money to? I just wanted to call to tell them that my parent died, but they want to start a conversation with me about financial options to pay them back. I'm not going to call them back, but what will they do next then? I know my own personal assets are fine as long as I don't make a payment myself. \n5. What order to creditors get paid back in if it goes into probate? I feel like I should get paid back first for the cost of the cremation, then the attorney should get paid out of the estate for services rendered in dealing with the estate, then medical bills and so on. No idea how this works. \n6. What  should I be doing now? Said it can take many weeks for death certificates to arrive, and it seems I need them for pretty much  everything. In the meantime there are bills to be paid including monthly  bills (like internet, TV) that I think should be cancelled immediately  (since nobody is using them). Should I even concern myself with this right now?\n\nThanks for your help ahead of time, my head is spinning here.,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/v5d7ze/parent_just_died_with_lots_of_debt_i_am_trustee/,False"

"nosleep,BloodySpaghetti,Thirty Years Later and These Wounds are Still Raw, I Don't Think Time Will Ever Heal Them, \n\nEinar has been my friend for as long as I can remember him. Nearly thirty years now and we\u2019re not that old. I met him in fourth grade back when we were both two wide-eyed, short, skinny boys. Now he\u2019s a towering man with a shaved head, a long blonde beard, and a lot of really shitty tattoos. One tattoo is of my name on his leg (I have his tattooed on mine). The guy looks like a Nazi, but he\u2019s not one. For the record, I\u2019m not a slouch either, but he\u2019s just a tower of a man. He claims to hate everyone and everything that lives, well, whenever he\u2019s trying to entertain a crowd at least. This man is a bit of a local attraction around here.\n\nEinar\u2019s misanthropy is a half-truth he tells everyone to explain his erratic nature and shitty friendship. Don\u2019t get me wrong, he\u2019s the guy who\u2019ll actually kill for a person he loves, and he loves a few people in this world. That said, he might disappear on you for months. He\u2019s married and has a young daughter. As far as I\u2019m aware, he\u2019s a good father and a loyal, loving husband. It helps that his wife is an oncologist. Even though some people in our town believe he\u2019s fucking everything that moves. The guy told a few jokes and sweet-talked a few women once or twice with no actual intention of doing anything else. Now everyone thinks he\u2019s some Casanova. No wonder he\u2019s so spiteful towards most people.\n\nHe\u2019s also got a cat, well, had one. An elderly creature called Karl. He\u2019s had it for sixteen years. Loved the furry little bastard to death. Called it his only friend, at times. It died not too long ago.\n\nWhen Karl died, Einar mourned it like a child. Not in the sense that he was all Hollywood emotional about it. Nah, but he was depressed about the loss of his friend. Around that time, we rekindled our friendship once again and I remember seeing the old poor thing, all thin and barely mobile \u2013 albeit content. Karl died in his sleep, and Einar buried the remains in his yard. I wasn\u2019t there when it happened, but from what he told me; it was a beautifully cathartic event. A half-smile sneaking onto his face. I knew he was bullshitting me. I said, \u201cyou must\u2019ve cried more than your daughter\u201d and he burst out laughing saying it was hard to hold back the tears.\n\nThat was the day after the cat died. He called me over, and we had one of our little private parties for two in the park by his house. Over the years, these little parties had gone awry occasionally. One such time was when we ended up tattooing each other\u2019s names on our legs. He\u2019s on record as saying he can\u2019t take his daughter to the public pool because people stare at him like he\u2019s gay. On other occasions, we\u2019d gone violent and gotten into fights.\n\nMostly his fault, really. He\u2019d get pissed at something, and I\u2019d back him up. As I said, Einar\u2019s not all right in the head. One moment he\u2019s fine, and the next he\u2019s ready to tear your spleen out with his teeth. One moment he\u2019s laughing and the next, he\u2019s cutting himself to sicken someone in the room. He hadn\u2019t done that in years now, probably since he got married. The night after his cat died, I had probably the most fucked up interaction with him and learned what made the man tick.\n\nYes, I\u2019ve known him for over twenty years, but he\u2019s never told me the specifics of anything. I\u2019ve known his parents, too. His dad\u2019s still around. His parents were pretty alright. Not parents of the year or anything, but not parents that would fuck up a child the way Einar was. There was something always off about his household. A certain void in the air that seemed to always linger. I remember there was a room in his childhood home that was always locked. I asked him once what was there and his expression changed. The color faded from his face and a mist of sadness formed in his eyes. He only told me they never went there. It used to be his brother\u2019s room, but I\u2019ll get to that later.\n\nEinar and I sat down and had our beers and dried fish. It\u2019s pretty good if you ask me. Call it a national dish for alcoholics. The sun had set, and street lights illuminated the surrounding area. We weren\u2019t even drunk by the time shit hit the fan. A few empty beer bottles stood on the concrete below us. We were talking shop, reminiscing about the good old days when we were young and rowdy. Einar pondered the idea of regretting the shit he\u2019s said and done as idiots kept on taking him way too seriously around here.\n\nSome gray, unremarkable shadow of an old man passed by us, beading us a good evening. I had barely registered the man. Yet something had changed in the air, as if a storm was brewing in the middle of the summer. Einar stopped laughing about whatever he was laughing about. Suddenly and unexpectedly. Einar\u2019s eyes darkened and the skin of his color seemed to turn almost metallically pale under the artificial light. He called out to the old man, who turned to face him.\n\nSilence pierced my ears for the longest moment of my life. I was trying to figure out what was going to happen. Partially intrigued by my friend\u2019s antics. I didn\u2019t even notice him picking up an empty bottle and smashing it across our table until it was too late. When my eyes finally caught on to what was happening. Einar picked up the old man and slammed him against the wall behind them.\n\nHe was a man possessed, like a draugr, an undead spirit fueled by pure hatred and evil. Screaming and cursing at that old man. I tried pulling him off of the man, but he just pushed me off and yelled at me to stay away. The longer I tried reasoning with Einar, the stranger his assault had become; he was shoving the broken bottle at the old man, telling him to do it again. Demanding he hurt him again.\n\nI could barely see the geezer behind the wall of rage that stood between us, but I could tell he was shaking with fear. So was I, to be quite honest, I\u2019ve never seen Einar so pissed over nothing, nor I\u2019ve ever seen him vehemently demand to be harmed.\n\nEverything seemed to move too slowly and too quickly. I could hear my heartbeat faintly under the cacophony of violent threats and curses. Everything became real again once I saw Einar cutting himself with the glass in his head before pushing it into the old man\u2019s hands and growling at the man. He was demanding to know if he\u2019s enough of a man to do *it* again now that Einar\u2019s a man and not a child anymore. My mind raced, and all sorts of fucked up scenarios ran inside my mind. Einar mentioned a name I was not familiar with, roaring it at the man\u2019s face while threatening to kill him unless he gets cut.\n\nThen, just as suddenly as it rose, the tension almost broke when Einar started laughing like a madman. He let go of the old man and screamed at him to get the fuck out of sight. As the pale piss-covered shadow of a human being shambled away, nearly tripping his own feet, Einar resumed his maniacal laughter. He dropped the broken half bottle to the floor and nearly pissed himself with laughter. I stood there, dumbfounded, as Einar ran to the bushes to relieve himself.\n\nWhen he came back, my heart still raced, and Einar was once again laughing like it was the greatest night of his life. He kept choking out the words, \u201cfucker pissed himself, fucking himself, the cunt\u2026\u201d\n\nI just stood there, awkwardly chuckling, incredibly confused. Trying to ease my way out of the tension. Einar finally relaxed and told me to sit by him. He wanted to tell me all about what had happened in his childhood. To be honest, at first, I wasn\u2019t sure if I even wanted to know, but I obliged. Einar sighed and his wild eyes settled on my form. His expression turned solemn and his voice became tired and almost withdrawn in its hoarseness.\n\nEinar told me when he was a kid. He had a younger brother, Ludde. One day, when he was nine and Ludde was seven, his parents left them alone at home. Not suspecting anything to happen. Their childhood hometown was a safe little haven of civilization. Back then, everything was simpler and everyone knew everyone. You couldn\u2019t get away with shit you can get away with now. Community is a dead concept.\n\nEinar said he and his brother were watching some cartoons on their TV when he heard the front door being unlocked. He had thought little of it. Assuming his parents were back, he made his way to meet them. To his shock, there was an unfamiliar man in the house. Being a kid, he screamed, and the first thing that man did was smack Einar so hard he nearly lost consciousness. He spoke of remembering how his head started spinning and a sharp pain exploded in his right eye. Everything moved slowly for Einar from that moment onward. He heard his brother screaming in the distance, and the intruder cursing and shouting.\n\nEverything came in flashes after that, as far as he remembers it. Being beaten within an inch of his life, and being witness to the death of his brother, being beaten as well. Tears flowed from his eyes as he mentioned vividly remembering seeing his brother being slammed head first into the counter. His voice cracked as he spoke about being haunted in his dreams by the memory of seeing that awful thing happen, hearing the disgusting dry cracking of bones. The horror of seeing his brother going limp. That one final blow to his head had broken his jaw and two vertebrae.\n\nEinar\u2019s tears wouldn\u2019t stop flowing. He was full-on crying. This giant of a man who mere minutes ago was about to murder someone was now weeping. I can't even imagine just how hard it was to recount all of that. That same man, thirty years ago, broke into Einar's home, looking for valuables to steal. In a cruel twist of fate, he ended up beating my friend half to death, and killed his younger brother right in front of his eyes. He told me his parents found them both on the floor, unconscious. He could barely utter the sentence about his brother dying from his wounds at the hospital.\n\nIn these moments, everything started making sense, the locked room, the nearly perpetual; almost emotionless grimness of his mother. His father had it easier, for one reason or the other. Clearly, what had happened hurt his father too, but it only destroyed his mom. She never recovered. Until her very last day, she was off and until now I did not know what was wrong with her, but now I do. She probably had to fake feeling anything. She died fairly young, too. A heart attack took her at fifty-one.\n\nThe details about this man serving time in jail kind of dissipated in the background of my feelings about my memories from when we were children. Justice caught up to Ludde\u2019s killer, and he was convicted and served his sentence, and after which he probably lived out an unremarkable life until that day.\n\nWhen Einar finally finished his story, he wiped the tears from his eyes and handed me another beer before faking a smile at me. He said something that hit me like a liver punch. He said, \u201cIt felt pretty damn orgasmic to see that fucker actually fear for his life. I\u2019d love to torture him to fucking death. And at the same time, now that it\u2019s over, I still feel like shit. I still know his ugly mug will still haunt my dreams and it won\u2019t bring back Ludde or Mom. Murdering him will only be an act of mercy.\u201d\n\nI questioned his logic, and he clinked my bottle before saying, \u201cI was it in his eyes, past the fear and the anxiety. I saw his cancer. And I pray it kills him slowly, torturing him to the very last moment. I want him to feel all the pain I\u2019ve felt\u2026 Not that it\u2019ll change anything\u2026 I just really fucking hate him\u2026 no amount of time is going to change that\u2026\u201d before chuckling and sipping some of his beer.,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/v5dey0/thirty_years_later_and_these_wounds_are_still_raw/,False"

"personalfinance,Nagisan,Pay off house with 401k?,Not for me, but for my parents, their 401k is rather small...only about enough to pay off what they owe on their house. They're in their 60s, but my father is a relatively high earner (>$120k) and is looking at around $3k/mo from SS in 4 years (more if he waits longer) plus a tiny pension at ~$400/mo (plus my moms SS, which is much smaller than my fathers, but not negligible).  \n\nThey would save about $1300/mo with the house paid off (interest on their mortgage is currently almost $600/mo).  \n\nTrying to help them make the best choice for their situation, I hate to see them drain their 401k but the alternative is average growth that probably isn't beating the interest on their mortgage right now. They're also worried the market could drop even more and leave them with even less, with not enough time to recover the losses.  \n\nAny thoughts on whether liquidating their 401k to pay off their house is a sound move for them?,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/v5dhnt/pay_off_house_with_401k/,False"

"nosleep,Jgrupe,I'm an Exterminator. Sometimes I Need to Kill More than Rats and Bugs,It takes a special kind of person to become an exterminator.  \n\nI was reminded of this again as I stared into the pitch-black basement tunnel, dusty cobwebs hanging down from the ceiling.  The darkness was so thick I could taste it - or maybe that was the asbestos.  \n\nTypically the asylum maintenance people took care of pest control for the old mental hospital on their own.  It was unusual for them to call in outside help.  This problem must have been beyond their abilities, I thought to myself.  \n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been coming from down that way.  The big ones are almost the size of cats.  I've never seen anything like it.\u201d\n\nThe young, pimple-faced security guard was just exaggerating, I thought.  Probably, anyways.  \n\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna need you to come down there with me.  I don't have a key for the doors.\u201d\n\n\u201cNuh uh.  I'm not going in there.  Not with all those rats runnin\u2019 round.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have a choice.  I need to get inside.  You\u2019re the security guard.  You want me to tell your boss that you\u2019re refusing to do your job?\u201d\n\n\u201cGuy, I get paid eight dollars an hour,\u201d he said, pulling a key off the big ring he had attached to his belt.  \u201cHere\u2019s the grand master key.  Give it back to me when you're done.  I'll be upstairs in the office.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks a lot.\u201d\n\nHe walked off, ignoring my sarcasm and leaving me alone in the dark, mildew-stinking basement.  \n\nI turned on my flashlight and began to venture down the ancient corridor.  Pushing my way past the curtains of cobwebs, I walked deeper and deeper into the darkness, the smell getting worse with each step.  \n\nWhat was that stench, I wondered.  \n\nSpiders were soon crawling on my skin and in my hair, up my sleeves and down my back.  I tried to contain my terror and brushed them off of me as best as I could, but there were always more.  Soon I felt them biting me beneath my clothes as I invaded deeper and deeper into their territory.  \n\nThe spiders were so distracting that I didn\u2019t even notice at first when the rats started swarming past.  Just a couple at the start, then a half dozen at a time, until soon they were moving around me in a fleshy, hairy herd.  The warmth of them radiated from the floor and I moved as quickly as I could through the swelling midst of them.  There were hundreds, perhaps thousands of rats.  I\u2019d never seen so many in one place.\n\nThe door up ahead was locked with a thick steel chain and a padlock from a century ago, but that wasn\u2019t stopping the rats.  In the glow of my flashlight I saw them moving through a hole they had made in the baseboards, after chewing through it like acid.  They streamed through this gap like flowing water.    \n\nWith shaking hands I pulled out the key which I had tucked into my front pocket.  I inserted it into the lock and turned it with an effort.  The lock was rusted to the point of almost being seized.  After a great deal of jiggling and desperate pounding against the door with my shoulder, it creaked open.  \n\nInside was another long corridor, stretching off into the darkness.  Rats were squeaking and fighting amongst themselves, running around on the floor, and I saw that the security guard had been telling the truth - some of them were the size of small cats.  I just hoped they weren\u2019t hungry enough to take a bite of me.  \n\nThis hallway stretched mind-bendingly off into the far distance.  I couldn\u2019t believe how big this place was.  The old mental hospital had been built nearly two hundred years prior, and it was massive.  It was also rumored to be haunted, but I had more tangible things to worry about than ghosts at that moment.  \n\nThe rats were a constant presence as I forced myself to go deeper into the darkness.  A large part of me wanted to go back, to say this was too much for me, but another part said no, this was my job and it was up to me to get this done.  I could only imagine the Yelp! reviews and what they would say about an exterminator too scared of rats to exterminate them.    \n\nBut the smell\u2026  The smell was almost too much to bear as I trudged closer and closer to the unknown source of it.  Something told me if I could find the source of that smell, I\u2019d find what was causing the rat problem.  I anticipated a leak leading into the municipal sewer system, but I never expected what I ended up discovering.  \n\nThere was a small gap in the left side of the tunnel up ahead, I noticed.  And the rats were pouring out of this space and into the larger corridor where I was standing.  I tried to push against the side of the gap and found it slid open further.  It was a secret doorway!  \n\nThe sliding door was covered in textured paint which made it match the walls around it exactly.  I pushed it open and stepped inside.  \n\nRats were nearly up to my knees at this point, many of them climbing on top of one another.  I used my flashlight to bat them off of me as some tried to crawl up my legs, one getting almost to my neck.  I tried to stop myself from panicking but I could feel my heart pounding and I was beginning to wonder what the hell I had been thinking going down there alone.  \n\nThe tunnel led downwards, heading deeper and deeper below ground.  It appeared to be crude and dug by hand, without using sophisticated equipment.  There was no lighting, and the ground was filled with potholes and ruts which I repeatedly tripped over.  I imagined falling face-down in the midst of all those rats and squirmed at the thought.  \n\nEventually, after several long minutes of descending deeper and deeper downwards, the space opened up before me and I saw I was in a large hidden cave system beneath the hospital.  I braced myself as I followed the trail of rats and saw a cluster of them in the darkness up ahead.  \n\nWith stilted steps I went forward to examine the source of the asylum\u2019s rat problem.  I couldn\u2019t help but wonder if the management of the hospital knew about this underground cave system beneath the place, or if it was a secret even to them.  But one thing was for sure - somebody had made this secret tunnel leading down to this cavern.  And the person using the hidden passage these days was doing so with some terrible purposes in mind.  \n\nAs I drew closer to the horde of rats, the terrible smell I had noticed earlier began to grow stronger, to the point of being almost unbearable.  I pulled my shirt up over my face and shone the flashlight beam towards the source of that horrible odor.  \n\nThere was a pit with at least a dozen dead bodies in it, each of them in varying states of decomposition.  The rats were crawling over the faces of men and women, eating their skin and pulling off scraps of flesh from their necks and ears, lips and eyelids.  The eyeballs were already missing from each of the bodies, as if those were the choicest morsels and the rats had decided to eat them first.  \n\nWith growing concern, I saw a few of them were wearing serviceman uniforms - plumbers, electricians, carpenters, and more than one exterminator.  \n\nI spun around just as the familiar security guard was sneaking up behind me with a hammer.  He swung it hard at my face, but he wasn\u2019t anticipating my quick response.  \n\nDodging out of the way, I saw his eyes were full of rage, focused intently on me.  He looked savage and angry as he took a swing at me with his hammer, then another, and another, each time just barely missing as I ducked out of the way.  He grazed me once on the shoulder, though, nearly crippling me despite the fleeting impact.  \n\nThe kid was young and he was quick, but he was filled with anger, and it was making him sloppy and careless.  Each time he missed, I could see his outrage growing, his face getting redder, his eyes more and more manic.  And with that came a slipshod lack of focus as he fell further and further away with each strike.\n\nI realized I only had one chance to fight back, since I was without a weapon.  My mind formulated a plan as I circled back around towards the pit filled with dead bodies.  \n\nWith my back to it, I slowed down, acting tired.  Then, as he came at me, I pretended to be surprised at having backed myself into a corner.  He attacked and at the very last second I dodged away, kicking him in the back as he went off balance.  His eyes went wide with surprise, having missed wildly with his attack.  \n\nThe security guard who had lured me down there went flying into the pit of rats and dead bodies, spinning and turning in the air as he landed so that he was looking up at me.  A moment later, the vermin swarmed him.  It was like piranhas smelling blood in the water - as soon as they saw the fresh meat they began to feast on his flesh as he screamed.\n\nI slowly backed away, watching carefully to make sure he didn\u2019t chase after me, but within a few moments the screams began to turn into bubbling gurgles and a wheezing death rattle.  Soon after that I heard nothing at all, and it was silent except for the sounds of rats eating the man as I retreated back the way I\u2019d entered.  \n\nThe rats were swarming back towards the caverns, I saw with pleasant surprise as I made my way up towards the entrance of the caves.\n\nFinally back in the basement, I stood watching as the rats\u2019 numbers began to thin, their masses returning to their home in the cave system after smelling the fresh meat.\n\nAfter the last ones had gone back through the secret door, I closed it shut and heard it lock securely in place.  The hidden tunnel was once again disguised to blend in perfectly with the basement wall, tucked away in the derelict hallway that no one ever visits anymore.  \n\nNot only that, but I had solved the rat problem.\n\nLike I said before, it takes a special kind of person to be an exterminator.  It\u2019s not for everyone.  And some people just don\u2019t have what it [takes.](https://www.reddit.com/r/JGcreepypastas/comments/raq7ay/all_stories_20212022/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)\n\n[TCC](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)\n\n[YT](https://youtu.be/9RybtYtDzAk),https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/v5dhze/im_an_exterminator_sometimes_i_need_to_kill_more/,False"

"nosleep,beti_559,Never answer a phone number that you don't recognize,I know that this title sounds pretty silly, but i hope this story will make you think twice before answering a phone number that you don't recognize.\n\n\"There used to be a time when i would always answer the phone,  whether i knew the number or not. This all comes down from a joke i had with my family that there was a possibility that a number you didn't recognize was from a kidnapped person and maybe you would be able to help, so that's where all the \"Always pick up the phone\" came from. \n\nThis all started about eight months ago, when i changed my service provider after moving to a different country. I changed my phone number too. And i also had to register everybody in my contacts again for this reason. I actually couldn't remember any of my friends numbers, so i only told them my new number, hoping that after that they would call me and like that i would get my contacts back.\n\nAnyways, first week after moving in i get a call from an unknown number. First thing i noticed before answering is that the first 2 numbers were the only ones that were apart from the rest of the number, which was quite unusual, since there were usually 3 spaces in the number where i lived. And it also showed where the call was coming from, but instead of a name, there were just the coordinates of the place.\n\nStill, i answered it.\n\nThere was silence on the other end for some moments. I was ready to hang up the phone then and there, when a small sound on the other end appeared: music. But it didn't sound like a normal music, like the one that you here when you call a location and they can't respond right away , but something people would now associate with the backrooms, like Caretaker's \"It's just a burning memory\". Really strange. \n\nThen a voice started speaking so suddenly, that i almost dropped my phone. It also didn't sound human, but robotic almost. It started saying a bunch of random numbers, but on a closer inspection, i realized it was saying the phone number that it had called me from. Then another few seconds of silence and that robotic voice started saying something again:my full name. I was confused at first, but before i could react, it started telling me a whole bunch of inforamtion about myself, like my age, my parents' name, my birthday, etc. \n\nAfter saying even the hospital where i was born, it suddenly hung up the phone. I was baffled. I thought that that might be one of my friends, but why would anybody from my friend group pull such a twisted prank on me, knowing that can get really paranoid from these kinds of jokes. I decided to meet up with them. \n\nWe arranged a reservation at a restaurant in my home country and all met a month after the incident. You may ask why we arranged it so late and that is because, first of all, we lived in different countries, and second, all of them were going to be on vacation for the next 2 weeks, but the 2 weeks after they came home, i was the one going on vacation, so only a month later i got the time to take the car for a trip over there, because i lived about 1 hour from the border. \n\nThe trip was ordinary, if not a bit boring, but 4 hours later i arrived in my home city. We all met up at a friend's house that was closer to the restaurant and from there we walked. After we sat down, we caught up with one another. I didn't actually tell them why i decided to make such a long journey just to go to a restaurant, so when i told them why i did that, they all seemed really confused. \n\nI told them everything that had happened, but their expression changed from weirded out, to confusion and to disturbed. They all said they would never scare me like this and those expressions all looked genuine. We decided to end the night and i made my way back to my city and went straight to bed.\n\nIn the middle of the night i woke up at the sound of ringing from my nightstand. I sat up and looked at my phone screen:an unknown number. Exact same format of the robotic voice one, just different numbers. Again, under it there were some coordinates. I didn't wanna pick it up, but curiosity got the best of me. \n\nSame call format. Music->robotic voice->hang up. Only this time it told me things about my life that i never told anyone, not even to my friends. And the detail was so precise, that only a person that was there with me could have known all of these. \n\nThis went on for about six months before i started noting the location of the call. I was feeling that it had some sort of importance. Every month i would get a call revealing something about my life that no one exept me knew. I never went to the police, cause the call were never threatening. \n\nI remember being bored one day and putting into Google earth's search bar the coordinates i have gathered along these months. They lead me to places that at first were pretty far away from my current location and they only got closer and closer until one of them was just a block away from my house.\n\nThe seventh and eighth's month call were by far the most disturbing. The robotic told me my full name and the date of my supposed death. 3 months from now. Even though i knew the possibility of me dying on that exact date were slim, i was still disturbed as to how or why somebody would terrify me for so long. \n \nA month passed and i got the eighth call. Silence. Then i heard my full name and my \"cause of death\". Death by drowning. This time i hung up the phone first. I sat in my room quiet without really doing anything for about an hour before i decided to finally go to the police. \n\nI told them what was happening and showed them on my phone, the entry of the calls. But something was odd. They didn't seem to be worried at all. They looked rather confused. \n\n\"Ma'am, there is not a single entry of any number showing on your screen\" \n\nI looked at them with confusion and then looked at my phone screen. \n\n\"No recent calls\" \n\nI got the hell out of there without saying anything and ran home. I locked the door and the windows. I went to my bedroom and locked myself inside. \n\nThere is no specific reason why i did this, i just this awful sinking feeling, like i was being watched. I just glanced at the window in my room, which is on ground floor and saw fugures. Im sure they were not human, because they were just like shadows:human-shaped black mists. They all just stood there except for one individual, he looked as if he was holding his hand on his ear. He was calling somebody. \n\nJust then, my phone rang again. I need to stay in my room. I think there are more of them outside my front door. I can hear banging. I don't have much time left. Goodbye. I think they are already inside.\"\n\nThat is how it ended. The rest of the journal was blank. It has been 2 months since i reported my sister missing to the police. I think they will discover her soon in one of the lakes nearby. The journal was the only thing that tells me that my sister once existed, as after she disappeared, so did all photos, videos of her that were ever taken of her. Like she was gone of the face of the earth. \n\nI think they are coming for me as well. I started getting calls very similar to my sister's and i only answered one of them, the first one. Even so, i know i don't have much left.,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/v5dni4/never_answer_a_phone_number_that_you_dont/,False"

"nosleep,No-Acanthisitta423,I wish I never became a trucker,Do you know what my worst fear was as a trucker? I\u2019m sure you can guess. Well, big whoop, it was running someone over with my truck. I\u2019m sure several share the same fear. When you have the responsibility of driving a heavy piece of machinery at high speeds, hitting something is a very real danger. But I shuddered to think about hitting a person. Whether it\u2019s a lost toddler on the road, an old woman, or some poor soul who simply couldn\u2019t take it anymore. Because being hit by a truck isn\u2019t quite like being hit by a car. When you get hit, you might go *flying.* Trucks are typically huge, and their force could, in all seriousness, tear your limbs off. Some people survive being hit by trucks - but a lot more don\u2019t.\n\nThe point I\u2019m trying to make here is that I was deathly afraid of hitting someone with my truck.\n\nAnyway, my fears were reinforced some weeks ago. I was doing a large shipment across state lines. I\u2019d been going for 8 hours, and the cerulean sky had sunken into an apricot orange, before curdling into a thick ebony black. There was hardly a star to be seen. The bleak road was a speedy haze, surging beneath the glare of my fluorescent headlights. I could hardly see anything outside of my headlights\u2019 sickly luminescence, effectively placing me in a void. A mundane, unflattering void, for hours on end. I only had the radio to keep me company.\n\nThe coffee I\u2019d taken wasn\u2019t doing me any favours. I was trying a new brand recommended by a friend, which was meant to work wonders. But, to my annoyance, it\u2019d hardly done anything. My body yearned for cheaper shit, like some good ol\u2019 Starbucks for the road. I tried to ignore the longing for cheap coffee, setting my mind on completing the journey. I\u2019d never fallen asleep on the job, obviously, and I certainly wasn\u2019t going to now. The highway was empty - it had been for a while - and it was just me. Trundling through the darkness. Very tired, and in all frankness, quite grumpy.\n\nThen it happened. The radio gave a brief burst of static. It came out of nowhere, and the sharp noise made me jolt. Jesus. Maybe I was more tired than I thought. Irritated by the interruption, I placed my fingers on the knob, ready to change the channel. Then, I heard the voice.\n\nIt started with breathing. Four rattling breaths, irregular in their rhythm, played through my speakers. Each time the voice would suck inwards, in what sounded like an extraordinarily painful process, before exhaling with a desperate, shuddering wheeze. After the four 'breaths,' a strange, guttural sound followed. It sounded almost like a person trying to groan - but all the air was compressed, only partly releasable. It sounded broken and shrill; the noise so strained you might've thought they were whistling. At last, the voice coughed. Roughly and painfully. Like their throat was lined with sandpaper. And I could've sworn, as I listened closely, that faintly in the background, you could hear something almost... dripping?\n\nWhat?\n\nI looked up, perplexed, and there he was. It was a rookie mistake. I\u2019d looked away from the road for some seconds, my eyes on the radio, but that was all it took. There was now a man standing in the headlights. He seemed old, maybe in his seventies or eighties, wearing what look like red, striped pyjamas. His eyes were wide open, his mouth set in a silent scream. I hardly even registered he was there before I was upon him. The truck\u2019s grill ensnared him, his arms pinwheeling in the final milliseconds, and with a disgusting *thunk,* he was gone.\n\nI panicked.\n\nSlamming desperately on the brakes, I swerved far too late. The world slowed down as the frantic squeal of tyres filled the air. I felt myself drifting slightly, and I desperately realigned myself before the wheels hit the opposite lane's guardrail. I jerked awkwardly forwards, ramming my sternum against the steering wheel. Then, there was just silence after a mechanical hiss from the engine. I sat half-perched over the wheel, my eyes as wide as saucers. Everything was frozen in stunned silence, as I tried to process what just happened.\n\nFor several seconds, I sat there. Turning it over in my head. Partly in denial. Partly in amazement. Partly in horror. I wanted to vomit, scream, and laugh all at once. It was a fascinating mixture of feelings, each one overpowering the others simultaneously.\n\nI popped open the truck door, in total shock, and dropped down to the rough asphalt. The night was frigid, the wind gripping me with its icy aura. My legs carried my limp body slowly towards its target, like a zombie.\n\nI stopped beside the end of my truck, looking beyond me into the darkness. I slowly reached into my pocket, my fingers shuddering and trying to steady concurrently. I wrapped my fingers around my phone, and brought it up in front of me, illuminating the blackness. I didn't feel any apprehension. I didn't feel anything. I simply shone my light onto the road behind the truck, expecting to see a bloody smear...\n\n...and paused. I blinked. Rubbed my eyes. Shone the light further.\n\nBut there was no one on the road.\n\nIt was empty. Not a soul to be seen. No blood. No mess that was once a person. No scarlet smear on the asphalt, with some roadkill at the end that was unrecognisable until you were right upon it. It was desolate as a desert. I shook my head, unable to make sense of it, and did the next logical thing. I called the police.\n\nSoon, the empty, dry road was bathed in the hue of police lights. I explained the incident best as I could to a burly officer who had alert eyes and probably a better coffee than mine. I'd completely forgotten about the sounds on the radio - it seemed trivial in comparison to the man on the road. As I spoke, the situation began to strike me, and my voice quivered. The officer gave me some professional reassurances and asked some straightforward questions. I answered them the best I could. Meanwhile, his partner swept the area, peering over the guardrail, inspecting my lorry and especially the grill. But soon the reality became clear:\n\nThere was, quite simply, no one on or nearby the road.\n\nAfter I voiced my fears of hitting someone with my truck, they charted it up to sleep deprivation inducing a state of paranoia. It'd happened before. They said they'd check the security footage from my truck, which was some comfort, but I doubted they'd find anything. Perhaps they were right? I've never really hallucinated before, but maybe I just got so anxious that my mind played a hearty trick on me. If so, it was well done. I damn near crashed the truck.\n\nI reported it to my dispatcher, regardless, and completed my delivery. I unloaded the cargo, and on a whim, gave the industrial vehicle a very close inspection. But there was nothing. No blood. No damage. It truly seemed as if I'd imagined it.\n\nThat night, as I was kicking back in my sleeper cab, I kept replaying it in my mind. If I did imagine it, where did the guy come from? I observed his face clear as day. And I'm no genius, but I know that you cannot imagine a brand-new face. It was a man's face. It was not someone that I knew. So, in that case, who was it?\n\nI tossed onto my side, wrapping the thin sheets tighter around me when I heard it. A cough. A pained, scratchy cough. I tore my head from the pillows, blinking abruptly. I knew that sound. I looked around the tiny compartment, scanning the darkness. Every shape jumped out at me, adopting the persona of a lurking figure. After calming myself down, and recognising that no one was in the cab, I instinctively looked towards the window.\n\nBut there was nothing there. Except for the condensation on the outside of the glass, highlighted by a streetlight, that was rapidly shrinking before my eyes. I sat up, bewildered, and started for the window. It was just disappearing as I got there, but I saw it clearly enough. It was the remnants of a breath. Someone had been breathing against the outside of the window.\n\nHad they been watching me sleep?\n\nI looked further beyond, into vast stretching fields. I could see for a good few miles, the land stretching far and wide. But there was nothing there. It was just me, all alone, in the cab of my truck.\n\nI rubbed my hands over my face, groaning. God, why was I being so stupid? It was probably just my breath or something like that. I needed to cut this out. This stupid overthinking. I needed to stop my brain from jacking itself up over nothingness. At this rate, I was gonna piss myself because of my imagination.\n\nI took out my phone, opening the camera app. Just how sleep-deprived was I? If I was scaring myself over condensation on a window, what about anything else I thought I was witnessing? I probably didn't even hear a cough. Auditory hallucinations are things too, I reminded myself, as I turned on the cab's light to see myself better. I flipped the camera's perspective towards me, expecting heavy bags engraved beneath my tired eyes, but something else caught my attention. Out the window. Only metres away.\n\nThe man was back.\n\nI whipped around. But the outside was empty. It was just the streetlight, lighting the land for several metres, before inky, near-starless gloom. There was, without doubt, no man outside. This was certain.\n\nBut when I investigated the camera, there he was. He was still dressed in his pyjamas and was barefoot. He just calmly stood there, a blank stare masking his intentions. He stared dead into the camera, and disturbingly, right at me. We both just looked at each other. I could see my eyes in the camera, wild and confused, while his eyes were simply... empty.\n\nThen, slowly, he started to move. His face twitched, and his fingers began to contort. Slowly, but with growing certainty, he was convulsing. He hunched over, then swayed backwards, and then his clothes were darkening. Darkening in certain spots, as pools of wetness blossomed all over his body. The dark pools continued to spread as he convulsed faster and faster, his body now snapping all about in no way a person should move. The darkening spots deliberately sunk through his pyjamas, and now I realised how *crimson* they were becoming. Blood. Blood was pooling all over his body like he'd been riddled with bullets, but his clothes had gone untouched.\n\nI watched, a knot growing in my stomach, as the convulsions reached a climactic height - and he paused. Only for half a second. Then, to my horror, he shot backwards. I mean, the man *flew*, as if some invisible force slammed into him at a hundred miles per hour. He whirled through the air, a hurtling mess of limbs and blood, and crashed into the ground. His body, disgustingly, bounced up and down, heaving back and forth. Like he was being run over by a heavy vehicle.\n\nThen, after some impossible thrashing and heaving, he lay still. I couldn't see him from my angle, what with him lying down and all, but I didn't need to worry about seeing the disgusting aftermath. He showed it to me. With his remaining arm, the heaving slab of roadkill, with the greatest of ease, rocked into a sitting position. I was horrified - but I couldn't even speak. I simply couldn't believe what I was seeing.\n\nHe was soaked in blood, and both his legs and his right arm were gone. The stumps were now torn remnants of flesh, leaking loose drops of leaden blood that splashed heavily against the ground. His face was almost completely gone, leaving a red pulp that caved inwards like a hunk of meat. The remaining eye, the whites filling with a pitch-red, glared madly at me.\n\nThe phone dropped from my hand, slammed into my big toe, and rolled safely across the floor. My fingers were shaking, every hair on my arms standing erect. I suddenly sucked in, taking a gracious intake of air. I'd been holding my breath, and I didn't even realise it. I spun on my heel, staring wildly out the window. But it was empty. No man. No blood. Nothing. It was exactly as it was.\n\nI scrambled for the phone, holding it up again. But even on the phone, there was nothing anymore. I was quite properly alone. There was no one there. Positively no one.\n\nAfter that, I didn't see the man for some time. But then the noises came back. At my apartment, I would be lying there, shivering like a nervous dog, trying to convince myself to fall asleep. But then I'd hear a sound - probably nothing - but a sound, nonetheless. What was almost like a slight, very subtle, *dripping.*\n\nAnd I'd hear the breaths. There would be that rattling intake of oxygen and the subsequent pained expulsion. The slight sounds would hover at my door, so quiet you had to strain your ears to hear them. And there was the shrill groan. It would come from anywhere in my apartment. Outside my door, from the kitchen, down the hall, outside my window. It was impossible to guess where the sound would come from next. It filled me with anxiety, always expecting the next groan to be right beside my bed.\n\nBut the coughing was the worst. Because every single time, the noise would be *in my ear.* A sharp, raucous hack, with a voice filled with gravel, would be projected straight down my ear canal. I'd jump damn near out of my skin, looking frenziedly over my shoulder. But I was always alone. I always expected his face, that mess of bloody flesh, to be staring back at me.\n\nBut it never was.\n\nThe sounds plagued me for weeks. They'd emit throughout my house, making me grip my shoulders with white-knuckled fists. I'd sometimes hug myself with such overpowering anxiety that my fingernails would draw blood. I felt like I was going crazy. I tried to block the noises out, tried to convince myself that none of it was real, but the voices would continue anyway.\n\nI became more tired. My world slowly steeped into a grey slog, my motivation distant and dwindling. The sounds kept me up all night, every night. I even visited a friend's place to see if the sounds would follow me - and of course, they did. They were relentless, haunting every hour I tried to sleep. The dripping. The breathing. The groaning. The coughing. Over and over.\n\nI saw my therapist about it, of course. But God bless him, the man was useless. He, like everyone else, just assumed I was overly paranoid. After all, what was it meant to be if not my mind? A ghost? The ghost of a man who, presumably, didn't even exist? No matter what I did, no matter who I turned to, it felt like the wrong decision. Sucking it up was a bad idea - but trying to get people to listen to me felt even worse.\n\nMy sleeping schedule fell to pieces. I'd find myself passing out in the middle of the day. Never while driving my truck, thank God, but certainly not in comfortable places. I'd sit down on a park bench at noon, needing to take a momentary rest break - and boom! It was 7 in the evening, with my fingers and toes freezing off from the imminent night air. But whenever night-time rolled around, the internationally recognised time for sleep; I was wide awake. The sounds, plaguing every moment I lay there trying to sleep, gnawed at my sanity.\n\nHoly shit, I was so tired. Not even Starbucks could do me any favours anymore.\n\nThen, there came the request for a shipment. I was to be the driver. It was going to be a long journey, and I needed to be well-rested before I started off. The night before the trip, I lay there, doing everything in my power to drift off. I'd taken some prescribed sleeping pills, but I was still wide awake. The sounds, showing up as they inevitably did, did not begin to emit around the house. This time, they were all in my bedroom.\n\nThe rattling breathing shook, wheezing with every inhale and exhale, from the corner of my room.\n\nThe shrill groan wavered through the air, high and constricted, from beneath my bed.\n\nThe grating cough hacked discordantly, not down my ear, but directly in front of my face.\n\nThis all went on for an excruciatingly long time. The sounds bounced around the room, shifting their positions every time, as I just lay there in terror. Trying so, so hard to pretend it wasn't real. I clasped my pillow frantically around my ears, tucking my knees against my gut, and just laid there, whimpering. The minutes went by. The noises, cruel and endless, became louder and louder, swirling around me. It all transformed into a rising frenzy, a tornado of sounds that cut at me like daggers.\n\n\"Stop,\" I hissed, clutching my pillow harder against my ears. \"Please, please, just *stop!*\"\n\nAnd it did. I blinked, with my pillow wrapped around my head. Everything was... quiet. Freeing the cushion from my ears, I listened intently. But there was nothing. The room was silent. For once, after weeks of torment, there was nothing. Nothing at all.\n\nI breathed a sigh of relief, turning onto my side. A warm, satisfying feeling filled my stomach. It was finally quiet. As the minutes ticked by, the sleeping pill began to take effect. My eyelids gradually worked their way shut and all my muscles started to relax. After all this time, all this torment, it was gone. The noises were gone.\n\nBut I shouldn't have considered it so easy. All at once, the heavy blaring of a truck's horn exploded through the room. With it came the frantic squeals of tyres. The deafening sound flew straight towards me, as a glaring pair of headlights lit the wall in front of me, bearing down on me like a hungry lion. I whipped around, putting my arms out in the defensive position, letting out a scream--\n\nAnd, of course, there was nothing there. The room was empty and quiet. No light. No truck. I slept facing the door for the rest of the night. My muscles did not lose any tension, even after the sleeping pills finally sent me off successfully. I had an uneasy rest, full of horrible breathing and dripping blood. Truck tyres, gore across the asphalt, the sickening thud of metal hitting flesh. It tormented my dreams throughout the night.\n\nThe next day, I felt horrible. I'd gotten a very decent amount of sleep, very decent indeed, but I might as well have slept for less than an hour. I drank a ludicrous amount of coffee to get myself going, and before I knew it, I was on the road. I didn't want to be. Not after all the sounds and the nightmares. But I had to pay the bills, and that was the way I did it.\n\nI was extremely careful on the road. I drove at heedful, safe speeds, taking my time with extreme caution. My heart skipped a beat every time I saw someone crossing the road ahead of me, or every time a car slowed down. Supposing I hit them? It was a tense and uneasy ride. I turned on the radio to try and steady my nerves, but every time a sudden noise played, I'd jump. The radio was a no-go. So, it was just me. Me and my thoughts. My terrible, paranoid thoughts.\n\nDaytime steeped into nighttime. Less and less vehicles drove on the road until finally, it was just me. I'd taken a few stops, to try and keep myself going mentally, but uneasiness was filling up my mind like water fleeing a broken dam. I just couldn't focus on anything. I had to keep checking where my stop was. More than once I took the wrong turn and had to double back. God, I wasn't set out for this. I needed more coffee. I needed more sleep. I needed those horrible sounds to leave me alone. But they wouldn't.\n\nGoddammit, I was tired. I kept expecting to hear the noises. The horrible breathing, the disgusting groaning, and the wretched coughing, all accompanied by that constant, vague dripping... I kept listening for it. I kept expecting a cough to bark into my ear, causing me to panic and slam the vehicle into the guardrail. But there was no cough. It was just me, sweating bullets into my seat, staring at the road. The long, stretching highway, transformed into a monotonous slog of rolling road. A road that went on and on, endlessly stretching into nothingness, with nothingness behind me, and nothingness ahead. Just a void. A void of nothingness that never ended, a black canvas built so that I could fill it with my thoughts and my fears... a black... endless plane... enveloping my mind... my worries... pulling me in... plunging me downwards...\n\nMy eyes shot open. There was a man on the road.\n\nI sat bolt upright, my hands re-tightening on the wheel. Oh shit. I'd fallen asleep. Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit. I slammed my palm down on the horn, my truck bellowing warningly. The man looked up, blinking dazedly. The truck was bearing down ferociously on him, as I put every ounce of leg strength I had on the brakes. The frantic squeal of tyres filled the compartment as I tried to swerve out of the way. The man opened his mouth to scream, but no sound emerged - maybe I couldn\u2019t hear him over the howling of my horn and the screeching of my tyres? In any case, despite my best efforts, it was a lost cause.\n\nThe grill swallowed him up. With his wide-eyed face aghast with terror, the man was sucked under the truck, his arms pinwheeling. There was a wet *thud* \\- a thud that echoed through the entire compartment. Then, far, far too late, the truck rolled to a stop. Instinctively shutting off the engine, I sat there, breathing frantically. My fingers dug so deeply into the wheel that my nails sliced the leather open. What was happening? I couldn't believe this. I'd been here before - but before, it wasn't even real. Maybe it wasn't real this time? Maybe it was more paranoia? More hallucinations?\n\nGod, please let me just be crazy. Please, please, don't let it be real.\n\nAfter several seconds of staring out the windshield, helplessly dumbfounded, I reached toward the window switch, letting the window gradually sink with a mechanical drone that punctured the silence. I sat there, praying silently. Please, God, don't let it be real. Just don't let it be real. My eyes, with the greatest of reluctance, cautiously wandered over to the wing mirror. I stared for a long time, my throat drying up like water in a wasteland. I looked away, then looked back, at least three times. I rubbed my eyes. I tried to unsee what I was seeing. But there it was.\n\nThe man was lying behind the truck. A heap of blood and flesh.\n\nI squinted my eyes, concentrating on the details. He was bathed in the red of my taillights, and... and his limbs were gone. Three of them. Both his legs and his right arm were gone. I could see that clearly. Blood, fleeing his torn stumps, hit the asphalt. It was a slight, subtle dripping. I looked closer, swallowing. I could remember what he was wearing, but I didn't want to believe it. They were pyjamas with red stripes. I pictured his terrified face - a face that I recognised. It was *his* face. The face of the man I'd seen all those weeks ago. The face of the man who once wasn't there, but now, actually *was.*\n\nAnd then he started breathing. Four, rattling breaths escaped his throat. Each time, he sucked in with a great effort - then shudderingly exhaled. He then let out a shrill, compressed groan, so penetrating that you'd have thought he was whistling. At last, a scratchy, grating hack fled his lips - and all at once, the pathetic rise and fall of his chest ceased. He stopped moving entirely. He was dead.\n\nI switched my eyes back forwards, breathing shakily. I knew those sounds. I'd heard them so many times these past weeks - and now they'd emitted right before me. Jesus Christ, what was happening? I couldn't bear to get out. I couldn't bear to look at it. The remains of that man. I just couldn't. Instead, I pulled out my phone.\n\n\"Hello? Hi. I've just killed someone. Yes, they're dead. I hit them with my truck. No, they're not moving.\"\n\nThe police came. I explained everything I knew they would believe - that I'd hit a man with my truck due to insomnia, and he was dead. I stated my name, the company I worked for, my number, everything. I begged for them to take me away. To just put me in a cold, dark cell, so that I could hide away from the world. This cruel, no longer sensical world.\n\nIt's been a few days since all that. I can't even remember his name. He was just some poor, old dude losing his sense of reality. He had a history of sleep-walking - that's their best guess for what happened. I'd killed a helpless, ageing man who was sleepwalking. It tears me apart. Knowing what I did to him. Knowing what I did to his family. Please know how sorry I am. I never meant for this. I never asked for this.\n\nI've been seeing him everywhere. In every reflection. Never as 'himself.' Always as what I made him. This bloody, splintered mess. He's always missing those three limbs, always missing most of his face. That eye, that blazing, deranged eye, stares wildly at me. Whenever I look in a mirror, or glance at a glass surface, he's there. Unless I'm in a small room, in which I can feel his presence further back, in the next room over. And every single time I see him, he's getting closer. He started some distance away - like the length of my truck - but he's getting closer. Slowly but surely. He's only feet away, last I checked.\n\nCall it cowardice. Call it regret. Call it mental illness. Call it whatever you like. But I know that this is the only way out for me. He's only getting closer, so close that I can see his face in disgusting detail. And I can't take it anymore. I can't take the guilt. I can't, and I won't.\n\nI'll be gone by the time you find this note. I'll have to use my bedsheets. I'll tie them around the bars. I've been writing this for days, but I only decided to take the easy way out about twenty minutes ago. I just can't keep facing it. The guilt. The fear. The terror, and all the confusion. I can't do it. I won't do it. I am in hell - and this is the only way to be free.\n\nPlease forgive me.,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/v5drsi/i_wish_i_never_became_a_trucker/,False"

"nosleep,Grand_Theft_Motto,It's Hopeless. Overwhelming. Pandemonium.,I was never a fan of our local IHOP until the craziness that happened last summer. There were just too many good mom-and-pop breakfast places in town to bother with a franchise like IHOP. But that was before the place got the strange new cook and started offering, in my opinion, some of the best food on the planet. Before all of the bloodshed and the violence and the fire, I would have said our IHOP was practically heaven on Earth during the summer of 2021. \n\nThe stranger arrived in town via Greyhound bus in early May. I was actually at the station that morning picking up my good-for-nothing brother-in-law when the IHOP cook came in. He wasn\u2019t the cook at the time, of course, just some young gun in a faded denim jacket and mirrored sunglasses that caught the sun. It\u2019s a small town and we don\u2019t see visitors much, so I tossed the fella a friendly wave. He smiled and, for a moment, I thought there was something funny about his teeth. When I looked again, it was normal. A car came and picked the stranger up a few minutes before Mike (that brother-in-law I mentioned) walked out the station, already smelling like scotch and Pepsi at nine in the morning. \n\nMike wanted to get breakfast before going to my house and insisted on IHOP. He even promised to pay, though I (accurately) predicted that he would tell me he couldn\u2019t find his wallet when the bill came. Still, trying to be a good host and take care of my wife\u2019s only brother, I drove my truck over to the IHOP. The joint was nearly empty when we walked in. Like I said, there were too many good places in town that didn\u2019t have that corporate vibe. As we sat in our booth, I was surprised to see the young guy from the bus station setting up in the kitchen. His jean jacket was gone, replaced with a clean white shirt under a dirty white apron, but he was still wearing his fancy shades. The man shot me a wave and I smiled back. It was like we were already friends. \n\nI ordered the country-fried steak and eggs while Mike got the smokehouse combo. My expectations were so low they\u2019d be more of a pothole than a speedbump in Hell, but from the moment our waitress brought the food over, I knew something had changed. The eggs were fluffy, the meat was seared to perfection, and the smell of both our breakfasts almost made me snatch the plate from the server before she could set it down. It was the best meal of my life up to that point. I could tell from Mike\u2019s expression that he felt the same. My brother-in-law was so stunned that he forgot to forget his wallet and actually paid for our food. \n\nAfter leaving the IHOP, it was all I could think about that night. I lay in bed, tossing and turning, dreaming of the steak and the hashbrowns and the pancakes. I was up at six a.m. the next morning and at the restaurant ten minutes later. Unlike the day before, this time the IHOP was packed. Clearly, word had gotten out that the food was better. *Much* better. I caught a glance of the kitchen and saw the stranger in there again, surrounded by steam and smoke, his spatulas a blur. \n\nThe young guy was still wearing his aviators, so shiny they reflected the crowded IHOP back at us in the dining room. I ordered the breakfast sampler, though for a moment, then ordered a quick two-egg breakfast on the side\u2026and sirloin steak tips to take home. All of us in the restaurant ate like it was our last meal. Food was flying, servers were diving out of the way like soldiers dodging artillery. Through it all, the stranger watched us behind his sunglasses, smiling in the brief moments when he was a whirlwind of action. Just like at the bus station, though, there was something *off* with the smile if I caught it from the corner of my eye. Something too stuffed, nearly bursting out.\n\nOur whole family, maybe the entire town, started going to IHOP for every meal, every day. The weird thing was, nobody seemed to be gaining weight. In fact, I dropped a few pounds that month. All of us regulars were thinning out, actually, growing gaunter by the day. I began feeling odd\u2013not sick, but *odd*. Mike was my usual IHOP partner and I noticed a change in him, as well. His eyes were drifting apart, his nose flattening, and his beer gut was dissolving until his ribs nearly poked out of his shirt. I felt a change in myself similar to his but unique. Every morning I woke up and my face was unfamiliar. My hair fell out in clumps and my jaw began to get longer. It was not enough to make me grotesque by any means; I wasn\u2019t even getting second looks on the street. \n\nStill, I knew that I was slowly becoming something else. There was no doubt in my mind that the IHOP\u2019s new food had something to do with it but, like any addiction, I couldn\u2019t stop. The food was too good. I\u2019d still probably be devouring IHOP four or five times per day until I was unrecognizable if not for the two new strangers that came into town that June. Both were hard-looking men, graying and tall, dressed in black leather jackets. Neither of them spoke as they walked into the IHOP but everyone froze to watch them. The larger guy held a hunting crossbow, one of the modern ones, locked and loaded. There was a hiss from the kitchen; the new cook, the one in the sunglasses, climbed out behind the counter, moving like his limbs had too many joints. \n\nI heard a *twang*. A crossbow bolt flew from the new stranger\u2019s weapon, piercing the young cook to the wall. Instead of showing pain, the chef hissed again, louder this time, enough that the water glasses on several tables shattered. He was clawing at the bolt in his stomach, trying to pry himself free. The shot had knocked off his sunglasses. For the first time, I saw his eyes\u2026or where his eyes should have been. There were only black sockets rimmed with row after row of tiny, sharp teeth. It was like he had a pair of miniature mouths, hungry and snapping, set above his nose.\n\nThe creature that used to be the cook almost worked its way free from the bolt before the second man in black leather threw a glass bottle with a burning rag. The molotov cocktail caught the monster square and the fire spread quickly. Those stranger hunters ushered us out of the IHOP as the flames began licking up the walls. Some of us\u2013myself included\u2013tried to bring our food with us. The two big men didn\u2019t allow that. I looked back from the parking lot to see the IHOP engulfed in fire. There was a shadow in the door, a thing almost like a human but bent and burdened with too many arms. I heard another twang and the creature went flying back into the IHOP. \n\nThey never found the cook\u2019s body. Both of the strangers in leather disappeared as well. Over the next week, it was like our small town woke up from a shared nightmare, a mad one full of distorted faces and inhuman food. I\u2019m a religious man in my own way. I grew up hearing about the fire and the brimstone, a vengeful God, and the temptation of demons who might walk among us. Gluttony is one of the Seven Deadly Sins. I think I came face-to-face with it in a small-town IHOP in the middle of nowhere. Whenever I close my eyes, I see the young cook and his empty, hungry eyes. \n\nI don\u2019t know who those two hunters were but I am sure they saved us all. Still\u2026it seems like I get a little hungrier each day.,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/v5e5fz/its_hopeless_overwhelming_pandemonium/,False"

"TwoXChromosomes,spawnofspace,Experiencing weird pain around my lady organs, any advice?,So before you say \"go to the doctor\", I can't right now. I am starting a job Monday and will have health insurance soon enough, and then I could go but I'm unsure how long it will take to get it. \n\nI'm having pain around my lady organs, and near the hip when I sit down, walk, lay in certain positions, and when I have to pee. It hurts the worst when I need to pee. I feel like maybe there's something wrong with my bladder? I don't have the burning sensation when I pee that you get with a UTI so I don't feel its that. I have an IUD but I've had it for a good amount of time now so I'm not quick to blame that either. I feel like there are lots of ladies that have probably felt this pain though and know what it might be. I am considering going to a Urgent Care but there are a lot of things they can't test for.

"atheism,Zorgas,Why is my saying 'its fiction's rude, but them saying 'its real' not rude?,(First post, sorry if Im doing something wrong!) \n\nI made a reply comment in another subreddit a weekish ago that kinda blew up in a divisive way. I was meant to be tongue in cheek but a huge number of fellow atheists and a bigger number of religious people took umbrage with my words.\n\nIn my comment I mention the Bible is fiction. Which, so far as I and more scientific minds can deduce, is a fact. \n\nSo why is it somehow socially *unacceptable* for me to say 'its fiction' but ok for them to say 'no, it's real'?\n\nWhy is it ok for them to say 'i will pray for you' and somehow not ok for me to reply 'that won't do anything, please don't waste your time'\n\nWhy must I politely accept their reality without asserting my own? \n\nI'm not considered rude for seeing that dress as blue/black instead of white/gold. It's just a different perception of reality and, like with the dress, there is a real true answer (blue/black).\n\nIf their belief was so strong, wouldn't they just dismiss my assertion that the Bible is fiction? Like, if someone told me 1+1=17 I would just shrug and move on because I know the truth.,https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/v5efcm/why_is_my_saying_its_fictions_rude_but_them/,False"

Cat urine can be pretty strong and I want to make sure whatever I use is going to be 100% safe for my cats. Will these options work or is there a better one out there?

"books,realdepiction,100 books 100 songs n1 \"The Hobbit\",Hello everyone, as a totaly self imposed task spawned by my abundance of both free time and love for literature and music, i have decided to review 100 books and pair them with 100 songs. I would appreciate if you guys gave me some feedback both on this idea and the way i write this text, because english is my second language lol.\n\nOkay, lets start with an easy one, J.R.R Tolkien\u00b4s \"The Hobbit\"\n\nIf you had to give someone the easiest entry into fantasy (or literature in general), this would be it, this is the most accesible yet refined piece of fantasy i have read in my entire life, the whole story is brought up in a very inteligent and charismatic way, the diverse adventures that Bliblo goes through are not only entertaining on their own, but they also serve as nice setups for the rest of events going further into the book itself and the entire LOTR franchise moving forward, it serves as both a good starting point in this specific series of books, and, again, fantasy as a whole.\n\nThe story itself is a pretty standard hero journey, but hey, thats what fantasy is all about, i would compare it to a really refined melted cheese sandwich (idk what else to call it lol), the thing is just very basic, but it has all of these little things that spice it up and give it a really cohesive feel, while also executing the basics of storytelling and character development in a very magnificent way.\n\nNow to the song part.\n\nChoosing a genre of music for this is rough, mainly because i want you not only to read the book (in this case 99% of you already have), but i also want the song to be enjoyable, and to pair well with the book, so keep that in mindo going forward (also recommend songs you think would fit in this criteria)\n\nThe song i will be choosing is the opener for the 1972 prog-rock album by \"Yes\", close to the edge.\n\nThe main reason i choose this song, is the parallels it has with the book, it is long but not the longest thing in its field, the basics of the genre and musical composition are executed wonderfully, and it is also basic, but tastefull.\n\nTime for everyones favourite part of reviews by randos on the internet RATINGS!!\n\nThe book: 9/10, could be a bit longer, but its almost perfect in this state\n\nThe song: 8/10, i kinda want more of those very cathartic \"i get up i get down\" that  Jon Anderson does i think twice if i remember, but other than that its pretty good.\n\nAgain, feedback is apreciated, and if you did it this far [here is a video of a cute dog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unOeqzSPEIM)\n\nSee ya soon!,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/v5erph/100_books_100_songs_n1_the_hobbit/,False"

"askscience,caleblewis94,Are There Any Diseases That Can Destroy Prokaryote Cell Walls?,Good morning from Atlanta, I am a college student studying History, though I am also interested in Biology and taking a course with a lab this Summer. I am learning about Prokaryotic vs Eukaryotic organisms and their functions and noted that a key difference is that most Prokaryoteshave a cell wall to protect them from bursting due to water absorption. I also remember from prior knowledge knowing that our intestines contain a bunch of prokaryotes to aid in breaking down waste, etc. I was curious and didn't want to bother my professor with these random questions that pop up as I'm reading the textbook, so I figured I'd turn to you kind folks on here to enlighten me on this random burning question of mine:\n\nAre there any diseases that can damage/destroy the cell walls of prokaryotes, causing them to absorb water throughout the body, i.e. the intestines and burst? \n\nThanks!,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/v5d9n3/are_there_any_diseases_that_can_destroy/,False"

"askscience,goldfishpaws,How does smell work?,At an interested engineer, totally not a biologist level, I can smell things.  When I try to understand how smell works, though, I get confused.  I've heard a couple of answers which I'm not convinced by, so thought I'd get some clarity.\n\n* Resonating bonds between atoms in molecules.  This sounds semi plausible, but it doesn't account for handedness, where (AIUI) for instance a left hand identical arrangement of atoms smells of lemon and the same atoms arranged right-handed smell of mint.\n\n* That suggests shape is the driver, which seems compelling, but then why do brand new molecules we never evolved for have a smell?  Not perfume blends, that's obvious, but molecularly.  If we don't have a receptor for a molecule shape, how could we smell it, and how could we evolve a receptor for something that doesn't exist?\n\n* Smell buds, and every aroma is a unique combination of the nose equivalent of bitter/sweet/salt/acid/umami.  This seems pretty unconvincing to me as with shape alone - how could novel molecules smell?\n\n* Nose as a diffraction column.  Doesn't seem intuitive, but unique graphs for aromas at least includes the possibility of novel molecules having a smell, but we return to the handedness question.\n\nWhat am I missing?  Am I overthinking it all, missing something obvious?  I mean it seems like something we should know, but I'm not seeing consensus.\n\nThanks for your ideas about this, it's troubled me a while!,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/v5b1rt/how_does_smell_work/,False"

"Showerthoughts,machineethics,You're socially bribed to launch from the track if the payment is in the other place.,It really is an open question, whether staying on the rails for its own sake is worth more than flying from them. Its about people. If no one cares that you're on the rails and staying on them burns, only total self possession can keep you on them. Self possession and selfishness. You're socially bribed to launch from the track if the payment is in this other place.\n\nIt makes staying on the rails an unequal balance of cost and benefit. Nobody cares for the sacrifice of bloody hands on the tracks.\n\nIf you hold to it or don\u2019t depends on what conditions are attached to love and who set them there. \u0003Why should a train stay on its rails without passengers? Maybe there are spectators too.\n\nBut we all know that spectators relish a good crash.\n\nIts about people. \u0003If people do not care that a train does not derail, \u0003why place it on any track at all?\u0003At the very least it can fly from them and nourish the spectators. \u0003Better than a long drawn journey of slowly worn wheels\n\nis a trainwreck,https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/comments/v5ey6b/youre_socially_bribed_to_launch_from_the_track_if/,False"

For example, let's say someone commits a racially motivated hate crime, yet 3 of the jurors in their trial are white supremacists who believe that that person did nothing wrong. Couldn't the jurors in that case just claim 'not guilty' and let the guy off free? Ordinary people have huge amounts of bias.
