I am looking to move a 10x20' tiny home that is bolted onto a trailer with functioning parts, except the trailer tongue was cut off and disposed of (no idea why). I plan on moving it 5 feet one direction, and 8 feet sideways from there. I am aware this likely isn't something I can DIY, but I have no idea where to go from here to get this done.

"TwoXChromosomes,Faithyxox,HELP! I think my period came 2 WEEKS early\u2026and I\u2019m on holiday abroad for the first time in 6 years,Hello,\n\nI came off the combined pill in January after being on it for 4 years. Before I was on the pill (I\u2019m 22f) my periods would come like every 6 weeks, I think once or twice they came within 3. It was very annoying and hard to predict. I\u2019m using the Flo app to track my periods as they went from being 4 weeks on the dot whilst on the pill to back to how it was before.\n\nAnyway, I\u2019m on holiday (woooo) for the first time in 6 years, and this morning I saw a little bit of blood in my underwear, and throughout the day there was very small amounts of blood. I thought I possibly could be spotting, as according to the flo app I should be ovulating right now (today is actually my highest chance of getting pregnant) however I was in the shower just now and\u2026there were quite a few clots. I don\u2019t think this is normal with spotting. There wasn\u2019t much blood in the tissue (makeshift pad as I didn\u2019t bring any as\u2026you know\u2026my period wasn\u2019t meant to come for 2 weeks) but when I stuck my finger up my vagina\u2026clot central lol. \n\nI\u2019m really annoyed cuz if I knew my period was gonna come I would have gone back on the pill to get rid of it for this holiday. We are going swimming too in the next few days and I\u2019ve never worn a tampon before. I\u2019m really hoping this may be spotting, but can someone who is experienced tell me lol. \n\nAccording to the app, my last few cycles were 35-36 days, one of them was 42 days . If this is indeed my period, it would mean my cycle was 19 days.\n\nI will say this feels a bit different, I don\u2019t have big cramps which I normally get and my first day is normally heavier, so this could be spotting but with the clots I don\u2019t know. \n\nAny advice or support?????

"personalfinance,fruffymuffy,Grandmother fell broke hip. Medicare complications and asset protection questions,Backstory: \nGrandmother lives alone-ish in the forest (literally surrounded by lumber companies). She has an unattached adu with a informal tenant and another tenant/squatter in a trailer on her property. The relation with the ADU tenant is he pays the equivalent of the prop taxes and some power plus helps out occasionally picking up her groceries. His contribution is about $200 month for a 800sq ft house/adu. The trailer people pay her occasionally $50 to cover power. It\u2019s not a good situation but when her husband passed, she would rather have these people there so she didn\u2019t feel as alone. She has one son, my wife\u2019s dad who is disabled and wheelchair bound. There are no leases. Adu tenant has been there 15 years and trailer people 5. \n\nGram was found by the ADU tenant who was called by my wife\u2019s dad to go check on her since he couldn\u2019t get hold of her. When we arrived at the hospital we were told that the ADU tenant registered himself as her son. This was not the first point of concern with him. We believe he thinks he is entitled to her property if anything were to happen to her. He also told us that if we didn\u2019t send her home for care and assign him as her caretaker then she would die. \n\nHer only asset is the house and property. Currently owes $50,000.\n\nI have 2 concerns: \n\na- how to protect her assets from the ADU tenant. \n\nb- how to protect her assets from Medicare if something did happen to her. \n\nShe is not doing well. She intends to leave the property to her disabled son. It\u2019s all that she and her husband worked for. \n\nThanks all in advance!,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/v5iprx/grandmother_fell_broke_hip_medicare_complications/,False"

I'll whip out my blades of chaos and the Leviathan to make chop suey out of their corpse, like the Mayans. Even the head on my hip can see all of this bullshit, and he was binded to a tree for being the famed lord of all wit. Together, the gods are nothing compared to us because, they're all mad with power and carnivorous\n\nArthur Morgan- Stay down demigod, an outlaw's here, you're stuck babysitting while I'm here chugging beers. You're sat in Norway, sniffing fairy dust, I'm in New Hanover motorboating Mary Beth's big bust. You better be ready cause Dutch has a plan, and you'll meet a fate worse than death if you ever hurt our clan. My daddy's hat is the thing I have after he was killed, you still have your wife and kid on your chest and you fight like your unskilled.\n\nDoom Slayer- Shut the fuck up, both of you now, I killed all of Hell, I can take down a couple clowns. I do all of it for my precious little rabbit, I love spilling guts, it's been my favourite habit. I sliced up Ranak, Nilox and Grav, your boy Atreus and old Micah are the only friends you have. One is God of Mischief and the other stabbed you In the back, leave us alone Kratos, let me give Arthur another fat hard whack. Mary Linton never loved you so why do you care? You're so fugly, you're the reason for her nightmares.\n\nMinecraft Steve- I don't need to hear this crap from anyone, tell me Arthur, how much money has Dutch made since Blackwater? None! Why you gotta rob Mr Cornwall for a boat? just get some planks, a shovel and go float your fatass down to Tahiti and gloat in my greatness, I'll go mining down in the Nether where I can't hear you fools, your rebuttals can't be worse than using Atreus as your footstool. And Slayer bro, try to be less cruel, I mean it's not cool, Kratos, go chill with some bitches in Zeus' inbred cesspool.\n\nSpringtrap- IT'S ME! I always come back, I'm here to attack, calm down Steve I'm not here for your silly little Minecart track. Burned three times and lived to tell the tale, to me Kratos, your sea serpent is just a stupid fat whale. Spent thirty years in Springlock Hell, if only Mac, Davey and Jenny had my immortal spell. You haven't seen me until I've gone fully wild, I was beaten by a child, but unlike TB, the pain is only mild.\n\nArthur- Piss off ya godamn Easter bunny, my death was tragic, your's was just funny. At least my death was mourned, no one wants you, you're just abhorred. You had your cock in a Springlock for how many years? It's been eight since my death and John's still in tears! At least Isaac don't torture me, but old Evan is sat in a bear with a bite in his cavity. Dutch is gonna take us all around the globe, your family won't be coming cause they've all been scooped and probed, and little Lizzy wanted ice cream but now she wants hope.

"nosleep,nilotheriver,I've had three names, but this is Han's diary. [Part 1],/Date: \u00abUnknown\u00bb/\n\nHi, I\u2019m Han, and I\u2019ve always tried to keep a low profile.\u00a0\nMy genetics are quite good at it: dark and plain hair, short but long enough to fall slightly on my forehead; boring features, not handsome but neither ugly; and my eyes are as simple as the rest of me. Other than on my chin, my beard doesn't grow more than a few stray hairs, so I don't bother cutting it.\u00a0\n\nI don\u2019t have a college degree and I won\u2019t try to get one. I work as a stocker at a local grocery shop, and my (rented) house is far enough from the others for someone to feel the slightest interest to approach it. I don\u2019t interact with many people, and no one puts any effort into trying to be close to me, which I considere as a success.\u00a0\nWe could say that not my appearance either my lifestyle are something that stand out.\u00a0\n\nI want to have a low profile. I want to go unnoticed, I want to be barely noticeable.\u00a0\n\nI wanted to keep a low profile, and I did have one.\u00a0\n\nIt was a sunday afternoon, the sun was already setting, and I was doing the dishes. The cold water was running through my hands and the little crockery I used to eat when I heard an aggressive knocking on my front door. Thinking that it must be my landlord, I dried my hands out and went straight to the entrance to let him in, as I raised my voice assuring him that my monthly payment should be on its way if he hadn't received it yet. Normally, he would scream at me in response and go before I have the opportunity to face him, but this time he remained silent.\u00a0\nI grabbed the handle and turned it, expecting to see the man who owned the house I lived in, and not the one I actually saw.\u00a0\n\nI swear I tried to keep, for as long as possible, a low profile. I was extremely careful with it, I made my life as insignificant as possible, but after all, they still found me.\u00a0\n\nThe son of a bitch who was standing up on my front porch didn\u2019t change a single bit in all these years. He had the same weight as he used to, wore the same jet sunglasses, dressed in the same black suit that the last time I saw him and not a single wrinkle had appeared on his skin despite the passage of time. I recognized him perfectly, even though I did not want to.\u00a0\n\n\u2013They are on it again. \u2013he said. Not a \u201chello\u201d. Not a \u201chow are you\u201d, or \u201chow have you been?\u201d He went straight to the point. Nineteen years have passed since I had the misfortune to see him, nineteen years that felt like a minute now that he was once again in front of me.\u00a0\n\n\u2013What the hell are you doing here and how did you find me?\u00a0\n\nHe ignored my question. Moving me aside with his arm, he stepped into my home and closed the door using his left foot. Then, as he walked deeper in and began to look more and more stressed, he kept talking without catching a simple breath between his words. I could see how his big arms were shaking and how his face had an absolute expression of fear and horror even if he had his sunglasses on.\u00a0\n\n\u2013I don\u2019t think they\u2019ve even stopped since. Maybe they were just silent, doing it on their own, working on the project with their own people under different circumstances. But I don\u2019t care about that, it doesn\u2019t matter. Is today that matters, not yesterday. And today\u2026 from now on, they are going to work on it again.\u00a0\n\n\u2013I burned them down to ashes, I made sure nothing remained. \u2013I looked at him straight in the eye, frowning and biting my lips from inside in disgust\u2013 I don\u2019t know how you found me or why you searched for me in the first place, but whatever shit they are on, I\u2019m not going to get involved in it.\u00a0\n\nHe put one of his hands on my shoulder and squeezed it firmly enough to give me a few bruises. I still looked at him with the same confidence, letting my eyes speak for me. I was not going to change my mind, no matter which words came out of his lips. There was no way I could be convinced otherwise.\u00a0\n\n\u2013I heard you go only by Han now. I can get it. I\u2019ve been looking after you for a while, gathering enough courage to approach you and ask you directly. But of course, there was no way that you could accede. I can get it too\u2026 But you should understand me, also.\u00a0\n\nThe strength of his hand on my shoulder increased dramatically. The fucking guy was too strong for me to handle it. It was impossible for me to move even if I tried, he was holding me still using just one body limb. He reached into his back pocket with his free hand and took a stun gun. I was looking him right in the face, and I shook my head several times. He knew that what he was doing was not right, he knew that he was going against my will, but that didn't make him hesitate for a moment.\u00a0\nI must admit that I was also able to fight more. I could use my legs to defend myself or try to move his arm with my hands, but I didn't. A part of me felt responsible, a part of me knew there was nothing I could do to keep from going back there. I sighed and directed my sight down.\u00a0\n\nNineteen years of peace that I knew were ephemeral, but somehow I had hope. I used to think that if I reached my thirties without getting caught they would never find me again, and I was only one year apart from it.\u00a0\n\n\u2013I apologize. \u2013from his voice, it was obvious that he was crying\u2013 I\u2019m so sorry. Finish them back, kid. I request you.\u00a0\n\nI passed out before I could answer. I also cried, but I could blame the pain on the electric shock for it later.\u00a0\n\n\n\n/Date: I don\u2019t know yet./\n\nRight now I\u2019m sitting on a chair, in front of a desk, writing these words down and holding back my tears to avoid them wetting the paper I\u2019m using. Everything is so damn familiar; the smell, the atmosphere, the color of the walls, the texture of the bed sheets and the landscape behind the window, which is completely open but impossible to pass through.\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s more than obvious, but I\u2019m locked inside what\u2019s going to be my room for the next few months. The door isn\u2019t opening and it\u2019s not going to until early morning, when we\u2019re going to be able to move and walk around for some time until we receive the next order. At least I know their procedure and how they work, if I don\u2019t remember wrong, and I could use this knowledge to visit the exact places that I need to in order to run away.\u00a0\n\nWell, things will come at their own pace. Now, I\u2019m here to write what happened, not what is going to happen.\u00a0\n\nI don\u2019t know how much time I spent unconscious, but it could have been days. Still, I woke up some minutes sooner than I should have.\u00a0\nMy neck was tied to my wrists, which were also tied behind the back of the chair I was sitting on. I couldn't move my legs either, of course. A thick cloth covered my eyes, so if I didn't move or make a noise, it was impossible to perceive that I was awake.\u00a0\n\n\u2013So, you are saying that the life of this one is absolutely meaningless, Christoph?\u00a0\n\nThat 's true. The name of the son of a bitch who bought me back here was Christoph.\u00a0\n\n\u2013I\u2019ve been seeking for people who have none, work at something useless and have a sad routine for years, and I assure you that the life of this idiot takes the first prize. It felt like he was asking to get catched continuously.\u00a0\n\n\u2013Alright. \u2013said the other voice, chuckling.\u00a0\n\nI almost chuckled too. Fuck, it was so ironious. Several years trying to go unnoticed restless and it was that that caught me back. I should have spent these years forming a family or building a career, but I was too scared to stand up and call their attention, even if I thought that they were all finished. I also could have denounced their behavior\u2026 and it was too late now.\u00a0\n\nA hand covered in a plastic glove grabbed my chin with two fingers making me \u201clook\u201d up, after opening my mouth with its thumb. Then, I felt a crystal texture lay between my lips and teeth. A smooth, tasteless liquid entered my mouth, which was clamped shut by the same hand as before, forcing me to swallow whatever it was I had drunk.\u00a0\n\n\u2013Ok, nice. Carry him now, big guy, and lock him in room 136. If everything worked properly, tomorrow he shouldn\u2019t be feral. It could even be kinda difficult to wake him up, and if it happens, let him sleep. We want no one to get angry, right? \u2013the other person laughed again. He sounded young and energetic, and his presence made me shiver.\u00a0\n\nChristoph obeyed him and had me on his back in a matter of ten seconds.\u00a0\n\nMy body started to feel heavy and my head dizzy. I was going to pass out once again, but once the steps of the young boy sounded further, the voice of the man who carried me kept me on alert.\u00a0\n\n\u2013Fight it, Han. Force yourself to throw up when we untie you and let you inside your room. Make sure to vomit it all. \u2013he whispered. He should have known that I was awake.\u00a0\n\nI obeyed him. Even if I barely could stay on my feet, I found a way to crawl like a worm to the (thankfully provided) toilet and forced myself to let all that liquid out.

"tifu,quiqtothequaq,Tifu by getting too high and hurting my girlfriend,I(17M) Decided to go to the movies with my girlfriend(18F) last night. We had spent the day together and decided to go see a certain movie that she had seen a couple times and wanted me to watch. She said that it was a \u201cweed movie\u201d, and that being high would make it more enjoyable. We get to the theatre and I end up taking us into the wrong room; so instead we started getting high to the Bob\u2019s burgers movie. I was really embarrassed that I sat us in the wrong theatre, but she laughed it off and said we should watch it anyway. I smoke too much and start having a really bad high. She hadn\u2019t seen that I had smoked a lot before the movie started. She starts joking with me and fake teasing, so I try to tap her on the cheek as a fake slap. I do it and she looks surprised and upset; I had actually slapped her and didn\u2019t realize. She looked taken aback and said,\u201dYou slapped me!\u201d. I thought she was teasing again so I make a crude joke about her interest in bdsm. Obviously, she gets really upset and asks if we can leave; I start to sober up and realize I hit my girlfriend and then belittled her. I try to apologize but I\u2019m still very intoxicated so I start to freak out. We talk for a bit and the more I sober I get, the more I realize she\u2019s upset. I text her later that night to see if she\u2019s ok, and she sends me a long message about me betraying her trust and making her feel gross. I apologize and tell her not to feel pressured to talk to me(that I\u2019m ok if she wants to spend some time apart).\nShe hasn\u2019t opened my last message and though I miss my friend, I understand that what I did was extremely hurtful and that she needs time to process things.\n\nTL;DR : TIFU by getting too high and accidentally hitting my girlfriend,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/v5iyve/tifu_by_getting_too_high_and_hurting_my_girlfriend/,False"

"TwoXChromosomes,maniacalmustacheride,\u201cWe can agree to disagree, what\u2019s important is that we love each other\u201d,I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard it. \n\nI\u2019ve been playing the avoidance dance for a long time. We put on our finery, slip on our shoes, and step\u2026step\u2026step the way through conversation to the tune of not sirens, but delicate bells of alarm. Peals that ring with resonance that rhyme with all the others so it sounds as a song. \n\nMy father finds it important to know \u201cwe still love each other, that\u2019s what matters.\u201d He\u2019s avoided, for a long time, any *uncomfortable* discussion. In my younger years, I thought this disinterest; present, I know now he\u2019s willing to avoid the topic to keep things going\u2014if we only talk about nothing, we can never argue about anything. Don\u2019t look at the problem, don\u2019t have feelings. Just show up, shut up, move on.\n\n\nThe weird thing is, my father was the hugger. My father was the one to say it was okay to cry. But looking back, I can see where he was already lost. I remember him being angry I walked out of church over a disagreement\u2014I was disappointing his community, his father was a respected church leader. But when his father sided with me, said religion was a personal choice and not a vehicle for societal motion, it was because I was the favorite, and I was being coddled. I didn\u2019t understand.\n\nAnd I didn\u2019t understand\n\nHow do you reconcile that someone loves you as a person but not as an equal? How do you hear their heart break when you explain you\u2019re closer to a 50s centrist than their idea of a modern day far radical leftist? How do you come to terms that you push their beliefs, and you know that, and that they\u2019re begging that while they believe in you being a lesser person of society \u201call that matters is we love one another.\u201d\n\nThere is a poison that courses throughout the narrative that our bodies are up for debate. It\u2019s a slow drip, spread out, like a mold quietly growing behind a wall: blossom, puff, spread, seed, blossom, puff, spread. And the language behind it has been sold as love. \n\nDo you love me enough to keep me safe? Do you love me enough to see me in others? Now that I\u2019ve had kids, do you love me enough to keep me alive? Or was I always just a vehicle for your legacy?\n\nI wish you saw me as big as I once saw you.

My gf and I had this thing going on where we either go to a friend's house, or get a hotel room for just one of us to indulge in debauchery since we have our young son. This time it was my turn. One of my friend's manages an apartment complex, so sometimes I get to use one of the studios to fuck around in. Before my son was born, I use to love getting baked and drunk, while playing Skyrim. Still do, but just can't do it as much. \n\nAnyway, I packed my tv, Xbox, bong, beer, and ordered some pizza. Chilling in my friend's apartment because he was in Vegas for the week. I proceed to get annihilated, and apparently I recorded a video for a FB group I'm in (Skyrim Stoners 17+). For whatever reason, to show my appreciation for them, I chugged some flaming hots mountain dew, took a bong rip, and slammed a beer. Which explains why I woke up with heart burn and acid reflux haha. Thankfully though, I got thrown into FB jail while making the video. So it didn't get posted haha. Granted, the video was pretty funny, but it definitely was a bit cringe. Still going to keep the video because it made me chuckle. \n\nTL;DR Got drunk and made dumb appreciation video for an FB group consisting of chugging nasty pop, bong rips, and beer chugs,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/v5j02s/tifu_by_going_through_drunken_camera_roll/,False"

Can someone help me understand this line?,So I read The Road, and while I appreciated what it was, I definitely found the style frustrating, to the point of being an obstacle to finishing the book. I recently saw a thread where Blood Meridian was recommended, so I picked it up for a camping trip. I\u2019m happy to say I realized my major problem was my own internal voice when reading. I tend to read very quickly, but you just can\u2019t read this writing at speed. It almost has to be a rough, gravelly, internal narration rather than just digesting the text. So long story short, I\u2019m loving Blood Meridian so far.\n\nHaving to slow down how I read this punctuationless mass has made me trip up a few times and re-read a passage or paragraph before I can get my head around the meaning. I\u2019m hoping someone can help me with this quote, which I\u2019m struggling to understand.

"personalfinance,Blue842throwaway,Looking for possible advice on either taking out a new credit card or a personal loan to help pay off some credit debit,I really need some advice. Should I try to take out a personal loan from somewhere to help pay off my credit card debt which I am almost always maxing out on like 2 cards, or just take out a new card hoping I can just use that while paying off my other ones? I am on top of payments so far but I know it's just a matter of time before they are maxed out between paychecks or something and I can't keep up. If the personal loan is big enough can I even use the money maybe set aside from it to help pay itself off? For example pay a lot of my cards off (might try to spread out some payments in hopes of raising my okay credit score), and use the loan to help keep the payments on my cards going while also some of the loan to pay the loan off? Like the monthly payment of the loan could be about how much I pay off on all cards each month. Quick math says about 8000 will really be able to knock a lot off my debt away and some things on credit karma says I might be able to get a 11000 loan. I know it seems like I have already convinced myself to do the personal loan but I don't know which one of the things credit karma recommends I should try and is a personal loan worth it? The interest rate is always the scary thing and I don't want to I guess get fucked over once I start the process. But also maybe stupid question, can I pay back the loan early and like end it? Can I do many monthly payments at once? The amount of money I said I might take out I am fine to change as well just really any advice would be great please.\n\nTldr: take out new credit card to use instead of others and try to pay others off, or get a personal loan and set up scheduled payments to pay off cards and use loan itself to help pay itself off if I can get the predicted amount credit karma says places might give me. What places should I trust if I take out a loan?,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/v5jd1y/looking_for_possible_advice_on_either_taking_out/,False"

"LifeProTips,Specialist-Owl-6204,LPT : Being organised when cooking makes it much easier. Also follow recipes loosely,When cracking eggs, peeling vegetables, chopping garlic, etc, keep a bowl during the whole preparation process. You can throw anything you will not use for cooking in that bowl and throw it away later. This will save you huge amounts of time in cleaning, make space for you to cook etc..\n\nAlso, in the same vein for that last point, store back in your pantry everything you do not use anymore, and prepare in advance what you will use. When doing so you will not have to do it when you're done cooking and it will feel much quicker. Also it is much more comfortable to cook when there is more space. Especially in a small kitchen. \n\nThen, not an organisation tip, but when cooking you should ALWAYS taste everything at every point. Controlling the seasoning of every element of the recipe is the best way to control the quality of the final product. Also it becomes much easier to detect where you messed up in a recipe.\n\nAnd finally, if you start to cook regularly and you follow the previous tip, do not hesitate to eyeball stuff, and don't religiously follow every recipe. Generally, for everything that is not a complex and/or technical dessert, the recipe is more of a guideline. Besides some recipes can have way too much something, not enough that, or have an ingredient that you don't like/have, but there is a substitute for it (always check the commentaries of an online recipe for tips and reajustments). \nYou are the master of your kitchen, you do you and you should make a meal that you like.

"tifu,EchoCyanide,TIFU by sh*tting my pants and dropping my phone in my own dookie.,Like many TIFUs, this happened years ago and only now can i share the horrors of the experience.\n\nThis  happened when I lived in Miami, which is my hometown. My partner at the  time used to drop me off at this intersection where the buses stopped  running before he went to work. I would walk to work for the exercise.  It was about 2-3 miles from my job.\n\nThe  morning started like any other. I worked out, and he dropped me off  before heading to his own job. Lord knows what I ate the night before,  but it wasn't good. Miami is hot and humid, and by 8am some days, it's  close to 90 degrees. I start my hot and sweaty walk, and within minutes,  there is a stir in my stomach. I don't think much of it and continue on  my way. After a few minutes, I notice the gnawing feeling in my stomach  is getting worse, and I start to feel uncomfortable.\n\nI  continue on my way, stomach bubbling and getting more uncomfortable by  the minute. I start the realize that I really need to take a dump, but  I'm walking through residential areas (side note: I walked by OJ  Simpson's house every day on the way to work) with no business or public  restroom in sight.\n\nI start  walking faster. I see the crossing guard I see every day and give her a  quick, uncomfortable hello as I continue my excruciating journey. I'm  within a half mile of work when I conclude that there's almost no hope  at this point. I'm sweating bullets, both from the rising heat and  humidity, and my ass about to explode.\n\nI'm  at the last stretch, I'll be at work soon. Too late. My ass releases  the demons, and hot diarrhea fills my underwear. I'm in a bad spot here,  but I do feel a bit of relief. There's a gas station right before where  my job is located, so I waddle over there with my shitty butt.\n\nI  get to the restroom and I know these underwear are obviously finished.  Before I can take care of myself, I have to finish getting the rest of  this steamy mess out of my ass. I sit on the toilet and release a  violent stream of crap. At the same time, I'm trying to get the things  out of my pants so I can clean up after. I pull my iPhone out (new at  the time) and proceed to drop it into the toilet full of my shit.  Realizing my day is already in the shitter (literally) before 9am, I  stick my hand in the toilet with no dignity and fish my phone out. I  wash it off and luckily it still works.\n\nI  clean myself up and throw those cursed underwear into the trash. I  shamefully glanced at the clerk as I sheepishly left the gas station. My  friends at work had a good laugh at my expense when I let them know why  I was a bit late.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL:DR pooped my pants on the way to work and dropped my phone in my poop when I was trying to clean myself up.,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/v5jik9/tifu_by_shtting_my_pants_and_dropping_my_phone_in/,False"

"TwoXChromosomes,olivertwist_sir,Reclaiming Ownership of my Body After Sexual Assault, I won't be going into any graphic details of the assault here, but if you are sensitive to that sort of content, please be careful if you're going to go further into this post!\n\nOn Friday night/early Saturday morning, I (26F) was sexually assaulted. I was high (edible marijuana) and unable to defend myself or speak up for myself very clearly, and my assailant (30M) was completely sober and kept going even when I was unresponsive and pretending to have passed out. It went on for several hours, including some \"breaks.\" I did not seek medical attention because I'm not physically injured beyond mild bruising. I am not interested in debating what I should have done differently or whether what happened counts as assault.\n\nSince then, I've felt like my body was not my own, but a thing available to others to use as they wish. I have been touch-averse to various degrees depending on how I was feeling at the time. I have two wonderful boyfriends (we are polyamorous) and they both have been extremely supportive and very respectful of my request that they ask first every time they touch me, be it for a hug, hand-holding, whatever. Last night, I wanted to have sex with one of them but as soon as I started kissing him I got more intense flashbacks of the assault so we stopped. I suspect I will not be comfortable engaging in anything sexual for a while.\n\nI even feel uncomfortable showering, because cleaning myself involves touching various parts of my body that my assailant touched. Anyway, showering doesn't feel like enough to cleanse me. I want to tear of my skin and slice off my breasts, which are perpetually there as a reminder. I can't stand looking down.\n\nI can accept not having sex for some time, but I'd like to feel less repulsed by my body ASAP. I'm looking for advice from fellow survivors with experience in this area, or from anyone with a good idea, on how I can make peace with this body that was used by a strange man as he saw fit. I will also be discussing this with my therapist on Tuesday, but a) I don't want to wait until then and b) she's only one person, and maybe someone here will have a suggestion that didn't occur to her.\n\nI have one idea so far: focus on what my body can do by itself rather what others can do to it.\n\nI renewed my membership to a bouldering (a type of rock climbing) gym a few days ago but haven't been yet. I'm planning to go several times a week from now on, starting today, and focus on developing my strength and climbing skills. I may also start going for hikes, which I've been meaning to do for a while anyway.\n\nI'm hoping that exercise will help me feel like I am the owner of my body again, but aside from that I don't know what to do and I'd appreciate any suggestions. Please be kind.,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/v5jwdo/reclaiming_ownership_of_my_body_after_sexual/,True"

"nosleep,A_Trans_Boi,I believe he's targeting me. (The creepy individual from the last Reddit post.),For those of you who haven't read the first story, I'll include a summary.\n\nA few days ago, a stranger pulled into one of the fields surrounding my area as I was making bird noises in a tree, and was watching me in a creepy way. When he left in his black van with tinted windows, I left the tree and tried to go home. He ended up approaching the tree from behind, and attempted to grab me, but soon realized I was no longer there. He went searching around for me, and almost got me too, but a deer went running, and it spared me enough time to escape. I hid in my bunker and ate Doritos, believing that this was over.\n\nHe wasn't gone for long. I heard a car door shut while my parents were away. I assumed that one of them was home, but I soon saw that the driveway was empty. I heard something that could've been laughing, and ran for cover. \n\nI took some pictures while I was running, and one of them caught a blurry outline of him. (These photos will be in my profile for all who want to see them.) He was still holding the piece of red paper, although his hands cannot be seen in the picture. \n\nHe pursued me through the trees with alarming speed, but I was able to lose him, given that I knew how to navigate through the woods and he did not.\n\nI stayed silent for quite some time, waiting in a bush. He eventually left, and I was able to go back home an hide in my bunker.\n\nJust a few hours after I went to bed, I heard one of the guard cats let out a low growl, and heard a scream and a lot of cursing. This was enough to wake me up. I gathered what supplies I needed from my bunker, and hurried to get my parents.\n\nI know that this wasn't just an auditory hallucination, because my sister heard it as well, and that particular guard cat was frightened. My parents checked the house and went to bed saying \"It must've been a dream.\"\n\nI saw him in the window and called for my parents. He fled before they arrived, and they were angry because they believed that I was pulling a prank on them.\n\nI spent the rest of the night in my bunker, hiding. He didn't come back after my parents checked the house, or else the guard cats would've torn him up, and we'd see bloody scraps of clothing scattered about the front of our house.\n\nIf you leave a comment, I'll most likely respond a short time after. My comments aren't visible, so you may have to go into my profile. (Thank you, GetOverItBroDude for your comment about the posts.)\nThis is because I'm new to Reddit, so the moderators don't want me to farm karma through comments. If this happens, you should see them in the \"Comments\" section of my profile. I address them to the specific individual, so you will know which is a reply to your comment.\n\nI believe I'm being targeted by him, although I don't know the specific details behind whatever he's trying to accomplish. I can't call the police, because my parents believe that I'll be fine. I'll just be sleeping in my well-prepared bunker from now on.\n\nIf you have any ideas as to what I can do, please let me know. This is creeping me out, and I'm sure that he will try again. I hoped that he'd just move on, but I'm guessing that this is far from over.,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/v5k224/i_believe_hes_targeting_me_the_creepy_individual/,False"

"nosleep,BornaBes00,What\u2019s worse than a psychopath? (PART 3),[PART 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/v0e748/whats_worse_than_a_psychopath_part_1/)  \n[PART 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/v2ndlh/whats_worse_than_a_psychopath_part_2/)\n\n\\[INCLUDES SEXUAL VIOLENCE\\] \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe station received a call from an elderly woman. She said that she heard a girl scream from a little wooded area behind her house. Her husband went to investigate but as soon as he stepped outside, they heard a man scream and then just silence. Her husband ran back inside the house and they locked the door. The dispatcher who received the call sent me to investigate the area. I arrived at the place only 5 minutes later. I got out of my car and with a hand on my holster, I slowly and quietly walked up to the trees. We had areas like this all over the town. They are like a circular area with a radius of about 650 feet covered in trees and bushes. Homes to rats, squirrels, birds, and all kinds of other little critters that made problems for the people who lived around. \n\nThe thick canopies blocked the light from the moon or the stars and forced me to use my flashlight. As I took it out and turned it on, it lit up almost the entire thing. I pointed it towards the floor in a way that wouldn\u2019t blind me, but would still allow me to see the surrounding area. I took a step below the canopies and expected someone to jump at me any second. I felt my heart beat so hard and seconds felt like hours. As I took a few more steps, I started to hear something. A soft and quiet voice. I carefully got closer to the voice. It started to sound like crying and yelping the closer I got. \n\nSuddenly, a pair of shoes appeared in the light of my flashlight. Pair of shoes still worn on someone\u2019s feet. Someone who was laying on the floor with their stomach on the ground. I moved my flashlight a bit and could see the entire person. It was a bit older man and he had his head pointed to what you would call his left. His left arm was spread out right next to his body while his right arm extended above his head. I noticed drops of blood on the leaves next to his head, but it wasn\u2019t the only thing I noticed. This happened at the beginning of Autumn, just when the leaves started to fall, but canopies were still thick. There was a... \u2018trail\u2019... leading from underneath the man towards the nearest tree. \n\nI lifted my flashlight and pointed at the tree with it. I expected to see a wild animal, a deranged man. All the while, I could hear the soft and quiet sobbing. After the light from my flashlight hit her, she squinted. The light blinded her but allowed me to see. She looked very young. At the time, I thought she was 17 or 18. Tears ran down her face and took her makeup with them. She hugged her legs and held them close to her chest. She had a bruise on her cheek and her pants were pulled down all the way to her feet. She was leaning onto the tree closest to the body and I noticed a bloody rock next to her legs. \n\n\u201cP... please,\u201d she sobbed. \n\n\u201cShh, shh, it\u2019s okay,\u201d I tried to calm her down. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d \n\n\u201cI... I wanted to... go through the... eh... this trail. And... and when I...\u201d she sniffed and cried. \u201cI was attacked.\u201d \n\n\u201cBy this man here?\u201d I asked her. \n\n\u201cYes. This man attacked me,\u201d she sobbed. \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s okay, shh, shh,\u201d I said slowly approaching and taking my hand away from the holster. \u201cCan you be more detailed? How did he attack you? What happened after.\u201d \n\n\u201cI... I was just walking when I felt... someone pulled my sh... shoulder. I turned around and... and... the man hit me with his fist. He then pushed me onto the f... floor and then he... he started pulling my pants off. He unzipped his pants and bent down above me. He... he... he fucking covered my mouth with his hand.\u201d \n\n\u201cGod,\u201d I whispered to myself. \u201cWhat happened then?\u201d \n\n\u201cI... I tried to reach for something and... and I managed to grab the rock. I hit him with my full force and he fell onto me. I pushed him away... and... then I... I got to this tree.\u201d \n\nI took a few steps closer while lowering my flashlight so that I wouldn\u2019t blind the girl. She had her eyes pointed at me and I kept her on the edge of my sight. I still had no way of knowing whether she was dangerous or not. I slowly walked up to the man\u2019s body and crouched down to see who he was. It was Cameron Waynewood. He was a well-known local rich guy. From a perspective of the town, he was actually a really good guy. He invested a lot of money into it and usually funded most of the festivals. However, since I was a cop, I knew about his dark side. Every cop knew about it but there wasn\u2019t proper evidence we could use against him. Someone took him to court once, but he won without trouble even though the evidence given against him was enough to lock him up. The amount of evidence was just not enough and he was a well-liked individual. \n\nAs soon as I recognized the body, I looked toward the girl. She hugged her legs more intensely and whimpered. \n\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t lock me up,\u201d she begged. \n\n\u201cNo one\u2019s locking you up,\u201d I tried to calm her down. \n\nI turned my head back towards the body. Cameron wasn\u2019t paying his taxes, mistreated his employees, and partook in sexual assault often. Classical rich scumbag stuff. Honestly, I was happy that the fucker was dead. His family is going to continue doing everything in the same way he did it, but at least he won\u2019t do shit. And at that moment, it hit me. The girl\u2019s going to lose the case. Even though there is evidence that she was the victim. The old couple who heard the screaming and her bruise from how hard Cameron grabbed her shoulder won\u2019t mean anything. Cameron\u2019s wife would bribe the judge and they would have the support of the people. This girl would just be locked up for almost getting raped. \n\n\u201cGirl, what\u2019s your name?\u201d I asked her. \n\n\u201cClara Sullivan,\u201d she shakily replied. \n\n\u201cHow old are you?\u201d \n\n\u201c17.\u201d \n\nThat made me feel even more disgusted. \n\n\u201cWhat were you doing here?\u201d \n\n\u201cI was going back home. I,\u201d she sniffed. \u201cI live in a house nearby.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo you know what he was doing here?\u201d \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she answered. \u201cI was just walking and he attacked me.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo you have anyone at home at the moment?\u201d \n\n\u201cMy mom and my dad... and my brother.\u201d \n\n\u201cCan you trust them?\u201d \n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked confused. \n\n\u201cCan you trust them?\u201d \n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d she answered. \u201cOf course, I can trust them.\u201d \n\n\u201cGood. You\u2019ll go home and tell them everything that happened. Ask them not to sue the Waynewood family and to leave the case behind because it\u2019ll just make the situation worse.\u201d \n\nClara just sat there and listened to me with tears still rolling down her face. \n\n\u201cYou should get up,\u201d I said as I turned around to give her privacy. \n\nI heard the leaves rustle as she stood up and pulled up her pants. \n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d she told me and started to leave. \n\n\u201cWait,\u201d I told her. \u201cDo you want my number? You\u2019ll need to talk to someone about this and apart from your family, I\u2019ll be the only one who knows about it.\u201d \n\nShe nodded and handed me her phone. I put in my number but didn\u2019t call myself to show her that I\u2019ll only help her if she wants me to help. She gave me a sad little smile and started walking to her house. I kept my flashlight pointed away from her and watched as she disappeared into the darkness. I took another look at the body. \n\n\u201cYou deserved even worse.\u201d \n\nOnly then I remembered that I should check for the pulse. Since he was laying on his chest, I couldn\u2019t see if he was breathing. He could have been unconscious, and that was exactly what he was. As I felt the blood pulse through his veins, my heart stopped. The impact of the rock only knocked him out. He was much bigger than Clara so it wasn\u2019t so bizarre. At the moment I didn\u2019t know what to do. He would definitely sue Clara if he woke up and he would win without a doubt. So, I did the first thing I could think of... \n\nI turned his face towards his right arm and picked up the bloody rock. I walked up to him and stood there. I was contemplating doing what I was about to do. Was it right? The guy is one of the biggest pieces of shit I\u2019ve ever had the misfortune of meeting... but killing another human... that\u2019s something else. I stood there for a minute when I noticed some movement on Cameron\u2019s face. I waited a bit more and saw more movement. Then I saw his right hand grab some leaves on the floor as his eyes slowly opened and he took in a deep breath of pain. He immediately noticed me and I decided to do it right there and then. I kneel down and with all my strength I hit his head with the rock three times. I was careful to wear gloves while killing him. \n\nAfter the deed was done, I stood up and dropped the rock onto the ground. I broke into Cameron\u2019s skull and left a mess of bone, brain, and other tissue. The right side of his face was completely unrecognizable and I honestly couldn\u2019t believe what I have done. I looked at my hands and saw Cameron\u2019s blood on the gloves. I was terrified of myself. The fear I felt at that moment was much worse than anything I felt before that moment. And even then, it was nothing compared to the fear I felt 7 years later. At that moment, I started to feel dizzy and I blacked out. It wasn\u2019t like I fell unconscious; it was like when you get too drunk. Your body is still able to function but you are not able to recollect what happened. \n\nWhen I regained my consciousness, I was standing next to the body and heard police sirens. I looked to my left and saw the flashing lights and realized that I didn\u2019t cover up Clara\u2019s footprints. I took a look where they were supposed to be, and they were gone. An officer walked up to me and greeted me with his gun pulled out. \n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll have no need for that,\u201d I told him. \n\n\u201cAre you sure?\u201d he replied. \n\n\u201cIf anyone was here, they could have attacked me by now.\u201d \n\nHe put the gun into his holster and took a look at the body. \n\n\u201cHoly shit. They got him good? Who is it?\u201d \n\nI softly clenched my fist and realized that my gloves were missing. I quickly checked my hands and the gloves really weren't there. It felt like a good excuse. \n\n\u201cNo gloves,\u201d I said lifting my arms and showing my gloveless hands. \u201cDidn\u2019t want to mess with the evidence.\u201d \n\n\u201cWhere are your gloves?\u201d \n\n\u201cI forgot them.\u201d \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re still young. You\u2019ll remember to carry them after this.\u201d \n\nI nodded and the cop approached the body. He crouched down and flipped the body over. As soon as the other part of the face turned upside, the cop quickly stood up and stepped backward. \n\n\u201cJESUS CHRIST!\u201d he shouted. \u201cWho the hell would want to kill him?\u201d \n\nWhile most of the cops believed that Cameron was a terrible person, some still didn\u2019t. Some were still as blind as other citizens. \n\nThere was an investigation but nothing was found. Not a single piece of evidence that could point out who the killer was. I don\u2019t know what the hell I did to cover everything up but I was satisfied with how competent I was. Clara called me 2 months later. We met in a park and had a walk. We talked about the situation and she said that her parents want to meet with me. She told them that she doesn\u2019t want that and they got angry so we needed to be sneakier. We started to meet in public places like diners, parks, theaters, and stuff like that but on the other side of the town. No one would recognize us so we didn\u2019t have to avoid people. For the past seven years, we\u2019ve been talking at least once in two months and she became something like a little sister to me. She and I were the only ones who know what happened that night, and even she doesn\u2019t know the whole story. She doesn\u2019t know what I did after she left. \n\nI phased out thinking of the incident while holding the pictures in my hands. They slipped out of my fingers and fell onto the table. I sat there reminiscing about the horror I have committed that night and I assumed that whoever sent this, knew everything. Every single detail about what I did. I continued drinking since I wanted to forget, but I could not. I tried sleeping that night but I couldn\u2019t. My mind just kept creating mental images of Cameron\u2019s body. But it wasn\u2019t that because of what I couldn\u2019t sleep. It was the dream. No matter how scarring murdering someone in such a brutal way is, it\u2019s nothing compared to that fucking dream. \n\nJust before the morning, I fell asleep for 2 hours. I was woken up by a phone call. It was Kaley. \n\n\u201cWe found a new body,\u201d Kaley said. \u201cIt\u2019s Emily Waynewood,\u201d she stopped for a second. \u201cCameron\u2019s wife.\u201d,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/v5k2ma/whats_worse_than_a_psychopath_part_3/,False"

"tifu,its_steggz,TIFU by getting motivated while stoned,Obligatory this happened yesterday. I guess you could say I was too busy mourning before I realized I should post here.\n\nYesterday I got home off work early, did my after work routine of eating, changing clothes, and smoking a bowl. After taking a few minutes to relax, I thought: it\u2019s a nice day, my boyfriend and dog aren\u2019t back home yet, I\u2019m gonna blast some music clean the apartment. I haven\u2019t had the place to myself in a while and I can really move things around and clean well without upsetting Poggers or being in anyones way. \n\nI turn on Spotify through Alexa and turn it up so I can hear it over the vacuum and have some fun while cleaning. I start in the kitchen, move all the chairs out of the way, and start to vacuum under the table. This table is a homemade Lichtenstein wood burned table, but the legs we put on it are these really shitty old card table legs. They also don\u2019t lock in place anymore. This is where I fucked up, several years ago.\n\nThe vacuum hits the table leg. It collapses on itself. There is a LOT of crap on the table. The table falls down on one side, making a nice slope for EVERYTHING on the table to bomb down like a skater on Baxter street. I reach out to stop the table from falling even further, but I was already too late. My poor bong had already reached maximum speed, hopped off the table, and I hear it shatter on the floor. \n\nWell\u2026 shit. \n\nYou\u2019re always gonna break your first bong, no matter how careful you are. But it\u2019s still a kick in the pants just the same. A moment of silence for the fallen. Still cleaned the house, though.\n\nTL;DR Got stoned after work, decided to clean house, vacuum caused the table to fall, broke my bong :(,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/v5k3c4/tifu_by_getting_motivated_while_stoned/,False"

You know, where the Parkland school shooting happened in 2018. I got arrested there with a gun and an ounce of cocaine when I was 16 and was expelled from there. I know, I know, I was young and I was very fucking stupid.\n\nSo today at lunch, in a restaurant, I was discussing the school shooting in Uvalde with my mom. Naturally, we have different views on the matter. To support my point and make light of the heated argument, I made a joke. I said, \" mom, you see, if I was in school there in 2018, I would have shoot that fucking prick and no one else has to die.\"\n\nYea, that didn't go well.\n\nI got slapped in front of my 3 years old daughter in a crowded restaurant. I deserved that. My mom spent shit ton of money for lawyers and psychiatrists to get me out of trouble. I only spent a night in juvie, 750 hours of community service and was expelled from the county for 180 days. Could have been much much worse for that kind of charge.\n\nTLDR- I got slap by my mom for making a joke that if I was there during the shooting of my former school, no one else has to die because I was arrested there with a gun years ago.,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/v5k7wc/tifu_by_making_a_stupid_joke_and_got_slap_by_my/,False"

"movies,Zarqonriose,Once upon a time in America - my opinion on why it's the best movie of all time (+explanations),Once upon a time in America (1984) is Sergio Leone's last movie.\n\nI consider it as the best movie of all time (and was surprised by the numbers off people who dislike it on this sub).\n\nI know this sentence means all and nothing, but I'll try explain.\n\nI first want to explain to you I see 3 different things : \n\n\\-The best movie \n\n\\-The greatest\n\n\\-My favorite.\n\nI think The Godfather/Casablanca/Citizen Kane can compete for the \"Greatest movie off all time\" spot. Because of their success technically, in popularity and in the critics. They have a great \"universal\" dimension.\n\nOnce upon a time in America doesn't have it (maybe because the industry killed the movie by shorting it and changing the cut).\n\nThis movie can be difficult to watch. It's long, the rythm is slow, but there is a reason for it.\n\nLeone want you to feel the characters feeling, and their evolution with the time.\n\nEvery scene, every line is make like Leone wanted to reach the perfection.\n\nThe ambiance, the story, the final scene, everything can be understand differently by the spectators.\n\nThe story of love, friendship, betrayal, transition from childhood to adulthood, all in one movie, but before all a story which show as time goes by, and how you can't change what you did.\n\nThe story, based in 3 different decade (probably 20', 30/40' and 60/70'), follow the life of kids in NY in their rise in the mafia to their end.\n\nThe performance of almost all the actors is incredible (you can have 2,3, maybe 4 very good performance in a movi). But this is on another level. James Wood, Joe Pesci, Elizabeth McGovern, Robert De Niro, Tuesday Weld, Jennifer Connelly...\n\nThe sets, the ambiance is awesome. \n\nBut the most impressive is surely the number of beautiful scenes (Noodles and Max meeting, the cake, yesterday, the babies, noodles and deborah, the docks, the smile...).\n\n4 hours on the downfall of a man, who refused to choose between his bestfriend and his love and lost them both.\n\nThe combination of this with the music of Ennio Morricone (probably the best whole soundtrack ever made for the cinema, listen to it on YT), make look this movie like an opera.\n\nI didn't want to explain too much about the story (for the people who didn't see it), but try to watch it in the longest possible version if you can.\n\nWhat are your thought ?,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/v5k9kq/once_upon_a_time_in_america_my_opinion_on_why_its/,False"

"personalfinance,rsp7373,Should I sell my house?,For context, I\u2019m a 32yo male who lives in the south. I\u2019m married, my wife and I have 3 kids. \n\nI bought my childhood home from my dad back in 2017 for 120k. It\u2019s a 3bd/2ba with a bonus room on 1.2 acres. I started a business (next month will be 2 years). Because starting a business requires a lot of money, my credit took a hit and with the tragedies and triumphs that come with starting a business, I\u2019m still working my way back to what my credit was when I bought my house. \n\nAccording to my most recent property tax statement, the fair market value for my house is 195k, but a good friend of mine is a real estate agent and tells me the crazy money people are making right now by selling their homes, basically saying I could sell my house for a good bit above 195k. \n\nI\u2019d like to cash in on this opportunity, but not quite sure what to do. Because my credit isn\u2019t that great, I know I won\u2019t get approved to buy another home, so I\u2019ve thought about selling and renting. My conflict with that, is that renting a house the size my family would need, would essentially make a rent payment at least double what my mortgage is. \n\nMy current mortgage payment is about $1100/mo, but houses in my area for rent around $2k+. \n\nMy question is, should I sell my house, use some of the equity to grow my business, payoff debt and invest? Rent a house temporarily until my credit is good enough to qualify for a mortgage? \n\nOr should I just sit tight, continue to somewhat struggle and ride it out?,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/v5kjvm/should_i_sell_my_house/,False"

"nosleep,hauntedhouseemployed,We Give Every Demon a Human, \n\nAs the title says, we give every one of our demons a human to go home with. Think of it as an adoption center without the humans knowing. To be fair, our website clearly states what occurs when you walk through our haunted house. It says the house is *haunted*, but people don\u2019t appear to care or believe us. \n\nI\u2019m currently on my lunch break and bored out of my mind. It has been a slow day. Mainly because we don\u2019t open today\u2013 anyway, I thought it would be a fun idea to tell you all about my workplace. It has good pay and decent hours. Not to mention the uniforms are comfortable and decent looking. \n\nYou can find us in NorCal, and we\u2019re open Monday through Friday from 11 AM to 12 AM. My boss first built this house twenty-ish years ago. He has this sick fascination with the other world. I thought he was the creepiest man I had ever met upon meeting him at my first interview. He still is, but the pay keeps me coming back and doing whatever he wants me to do. \n\nAs I said, this man is obsessed with the other side and collects haunted artifacts. I have no clue where he gets them, and I don\u2019t ask him either. They are locked in the basement with at least ten locks on the door. Every month some \u201cpriest\u201d comes to do a cleansing on the door. There is nothing holy or innocent about that man. \n\nI\u2019m not allowed to go down there but meet the boss at the door and take whatever artifact he has to one of the rooms. It varies every time. The house is three stories with nine rooms, each one having a different theme, but they all tie together. It\u2019s like a story, and each room tells a separate part. \n\nIn each artifact is what I call a \"pet.\" Boss said to stop calling it that because it\u2019s disrespectful. I don\u2019t care. \n\nWhen I reach the room, I place it down on a table or in a cabinet (it depends on the theme) and leave. A group of people will come through later in the day, and that\u2019s that. \n\nAll of the doors are locked and can only be unlocked from the room I\u2019m stationed in. There\u2019s a moment when I have to lock the room and shut off all the lights. That\u2019s when the pet leaves the artifact and selects its human. Sometimes the pet chooses one of the actors in the room, and we aren\u2019t aware of that until the next day when they return yelling about some \u201cthat thing tried to drag me across my apartment last night.\u201d \n\nYou may be wondering why the inhabitants are so patient and obedient for demons. Well, just like me, they listen to whatever the boss says. He tells it when it can leave the artifact and when it can\u2019t. That\u2019s probably why I\u2019ve never been \u201cchosen\u201d even though I\u2019m the one handling them. \n\nThat should give you some idea about the type of man I work for. I mean, even demons obey his every word. Makes a fella wonder.\n\nAfter it has chosen its human, it will follow them throughout the rest of the house. I\u2019m not sure how it can leave the house, but I suspect the boss has something to do with that. When they\u2019ve reached the door, the boss is there to greet them. He thanks them for coming to his house and being such kind guests. As a goodbye, he says, \"-and I hope nothing follows you out,\" followed by me cutting the lights. He\u2019s gone by the time I turn them back on. \n\nI\u2019ve asked the other staff members if they\u2019ve noticed he always says this, but they haven\u2019t. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s because they aren\u2019t close enough to hear or simply pay no mind to this creepy man when they aren\u2019t the one being addressed. \n\nWhat happens after they leave the house is not our fault. Whatever happens to the human is not our fault. We are not liable for any accidents or deaths after they have left the house. There is no way of knowing if it\u2019ll harm its human the moment they\u2019re down the road or when they\u2019ve reached their home. Hell, we don\u2019t know if it\u2019ll do any harm. \n\n But more times than not, it does. \n\nThere is a contract people sign upon purchasing tickets online. If you do not read it carefully, then that is on you. We cannot be charged for anything once your name is signed. As a matter of fact, we cannot be charged for any harm that occurs while you\u2019re in the house either. That doesn\u2019t mean we haven\u2019t been visited by some stranger trying to serve the boss papers. \n\nWe win every court case because people are nonbelievers. I guess that\u2019s a good thing. \n\nWe\u2019ve been seeing this woman near the front gate at random times throughout the day. The boss recognized her as a guest who had visited nearly a month ago. And accompanying her is a \u201cfigure darker than the pits of Hell,\u201d as the boss puts it. I don\u2019t see that. All I see is a strange woman staring at the house. \n\nShe doesn\u2019t come up the driveway, nor does she bother us. The boss says to steer clear of her, so I do. \n\nSome of the guests have even assumed she\u2019s one of our actors. I thought that was kind of funny, but the boss didn\u2019t. He had gone out to talk to her earlier today, but she didn\u2019t react well to that. She started screaming at him. \n\nBy that, I mean just straight screaming in his face. Said nothing but screamed this horrendous, high-pitch scream. I was standing at the front door watching when the screeching started. It startled me enough to move toward them. Although the man does scare me, I couldn\u2019t let him get hurt either. \n\nThe boss seemed shaken by this sudden reaction and backed away from the woman. If a man like him was unnerved by her, I had every reason to be afraid of her. He met me halfway and told me to call the cops to get her escorted off the property. She was gone by the time they arrived but agreed to stay for a little bit just in case she returned. She didn\u2019t. \n\nThere isn\u2019t much police can do here. You can\u2019t exactly have them parked out front just because some woman screamed in your face. They did tell us to call them the second we saw her again. \n\nAnyway, that\u2019s all the time I have right now. In ten minutes, I have to meet the boss and take a new artifact to the baby\u2019s room. It\u2019s a lamp of all things. Honestly, that is one of the only rooms that scares me. According to the tag it had when it first arrived, something called Belhale or Begluigh was attached to it. It was ranked a level two, so I hardly think it matters if I get its name correct.,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/v5kljt/we_give_every_demon_a_human/,False"

"gaming,runesigrid,Affordable Desktop Advice,Hi everyone,\n\nI know absolutely nothing about computers and would like some advice on what (affordable, because I'm extremely broke) computer would run my games. I only play The Sims 3. I know it is a big game but I don't play anything else, so the computer would only have to run that. I bought the game and all my packs through Origin recently after using discs for years, so if the computer is able to run it through Origin that's enough, it wouldn't need a disc drive for me.\n\nI just ran into some issues trying to launch on my partner's computer which he kindly offered to me, and figured the only way to be able to play eventually is to buy a computer to play on. The issue is just that I  spent a lot of money on the packs on Origin after my discs unexpectedly stopped working, so a cheap computer is sadly my only option at the moment, which makes the search for it a lot more difficult!\n\nI figured I would ask on here since I don't know what to look for in a computer. Growing up, I always played on our family computer, which couldn't have cost much since my family did not have a lot of money, but it always ran the game well. That's all I need the computer for, so if anyone has any tips on what I need to look for in a computer, or even a tip for an affordable everyday computer, I would really appreciate it!\n\nI'm in Ireland if that helps shop-wise.\n\nThanks so much in advance!,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/v5kr2n/affordable_desktop_advice/,False"

"nosleep,A_Trans_Boi,He's targeting me..,For those of you who haven't read the first story, I'll include a summary.\n\nA few days ago, a stranger pulled into one of the fields surrounding my area as I was making bird noises in a tree, and was watching me in a creepy way. When he left in his black van with tinted windows, I left the tree and tried to go home. He ended up approaching the tree from behind, and attempted to grab me, but soon realized I was no longer there. He went searching around for me, and almost got me too, but a deer went running, and it spared me enough time to escape. I hid in my bunker and ate Doritos, believing that this was over.\n\nHe wasn't gone for long. I heard a car door shut while my parents were away. I assumed that one of them was home, but I soon saw that the driveway was empty. I heard something that could've been laughing, and ran for cover. \n\nI took some pictures while I was running, and one of them caught a blurry outline of him. (These photos will be in my profile for all who want to see them.) He was still holding the piece of red paper, although his hands cannot be seen in the picture. \n\nHe pursued me through the trees with alarming speed, but I was able to lose him, given that I knew how to navigate through the woods and he did not.\n\nI stayed silent for quite some time, waiting in a bush. He eventually left, and I was able to go back home an hide in my bunker.\n\nJust a few hours after I went to bed, I heard one of the guard cats let out a low growl, and heard a scream and a lot of cursing. This was enough to wake me up. I gathered what supplies I needed from my bunker, and hurried to get my parents.\n\nI know that this wasn't just an auditory hallucination, because my sister heard it as well, and that particular guard cat was frightened. My parents checked the house and went to bed saying \"It must've been a dream.\"\n\nI saw him in the window and called for my parents. He fled before they arrived, and they were angry because they believed that I was pulling a prank on them.\n\nI spent the rest of the night in my bunker, hiding. He didn't come back after my parents checked the house, or else the guard cats would've torn him up, and we'd see bloody scraps of clothing scattered about the front of our house.\n\nIf you leave a comment, I'll most likely respond a short time after. My comments aren't visible, so you may have to go into my profile. (Thank you, GetOverItBroDude for your comment on this issue.) This is because I'm a new user, so Reddit doesn't want me to farm karma through comments. Go into the section labeled \"Comments\" and they should be there. If I answered your comment, your username should be at the top of the reply comment.\n\nI'd originally thought that this was a one-time only sort of thing, but it has continued. I believe he's targeting me, for whatever the reason may be. I don't know why he's doing it, but it doesn't look as if it's going to stop soon. I'll be sleeping in my well-prepared bunker from now on.,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/v5ks84/hes_targeting_me/,False"

"TwoXChromosomes,dyslexicwriterwrites,Previous Out-of-Control Fear of Trans Escalates to Legalizing Abuse of Minors,At 11:15 p.m. last Wednesday (June 1st), the Republicans of Ohio House of Representatives committed some underhanded bullshit by adding language to an unrelated bill creating the ground work for legal abuse of minors. The bill they were suppose to be voting on was House Bill 151 that revise the Ohio\u2019s Teacher Residency Program. The new language, Sub H.B. 151, legalizes the policing of girls in sports in the fear of trans participation.  \n   \nThe bill claims to require \u201cschools, state institutions of higher education, and private colleges to designate separate single-sex teams and sports for each sex.\u201d But as always, policy rooted in fear and buzz-words is poorly worded and lacking any actual structure or limitation. It\u2019s some bullshit. Regardless of your fear/hate/bias against the trans-community, its pure dangerous bullshit.  \n  \nAccording to the Ohio High School Athletic Association, there is only one girl in the entire state that is \u2018trans\u2019 and on a school sports team. One student, and the Republicans spent countless hours and endless effort to write a whole bill to \u2018address this issue\u2019. But don\u2019t let that fool you. Any girl who is a participant of a sports team at any \u201cschool that participates in athletic competitions or events administered by an organization that regulates interscholastic athletic conferences or events\u201d is a possible target of this bill.  \n\nPlease note, the youngest elementary school students are around 6 years old. 6 years old, and they can be subjected to the following (copied&pasted from the bill):  \n  \n(C) If a participant's sex is disputed, the participant shall establish the participant's sex by presenting a signed physician's statement indicating the participant's sex based upon only the following:  \n      (1) The participant's internal and external reproductive anatomy;  \n      (2) The participant's normal endogenously produced levels of testosterone;  \n      (3) An analysis of the participant's genetic makeup.   \n\nThere is no restrictions on who is allowed to dispute a player\u2019s sex. Opposing team, middle-school-rival, a parent with a vendetta, hell even a sick fuck like Larry Nassar, are all allowed to target young girls to have their \u2018internal and external reproductive anatomy\u2019 examined. Because that wording is \u2018only the following\u2019 not \u2018any of the following\u2019. There is no protection for the young girls against bad faith claims.  \n   \nI\u2019m angry and confused that this was allowed, or even drafted. I wish I had some sort of witty line to end this on. Instead I will leave you with the knowledge that Rep. Jena Powell, writer of the original H.B. 151 and supporter of the above addition to her bill, is up for re-election in November (primary in august). I strongly urge anyone and everyone able to vote against her to please vote. You know, for the children.  \n  \n  \n  \n** As the world\u2019s most mediocre speller, please have grace when complaining about any spelling errors. It\u2019s never been my strong suit.\n  \nLinks (mobile):  \n\u2022 The bill in question (sub H.B. 151); https://search-prod.lis.state.oh.us/solarapi/v1/general_assembly_134/bills/hb151/PH/02/hb151_02_PH?format=pdf  \n\u2022 Best article reporting this: https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2022/06/03/gop-passes-bill-aiming-to-root-out-suspected-transgender-female-athletes-with-genital-inspection/  \n\u2022\u00a0How I found out about it: https://twitter.com/polevaultpower/status/1533263117911613440?s=10&t=khA7Mpju35Z9IxJFsUJMgQ,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/v5jdco/previous_outofcontrol_fear_of_trans_escalates_to/,False"

I'm mostly interested in a documentary or well-made, well-sourced video as I've been reading and writing a bit too much lately and wanted to watch something for a change, but I'd love to have some book suggestions too!

By the time I turned around the shorts just yanked infront of me...ripping and falling to the ground...\n\nI panicked and yelled \"oh god\" and immediately went to cover my junk with my t shirt...dropping the Starbucks on the ground. \n\nI could see her covering her mouth with her hands while trying not to laugh....before she said \"let me go to my room and call the front desk for you\"\n\nShe left and I spammed the elevator button, got in (luckily empty) and made it straight back to my room. \n\nBeen talking about this with my friends and they insisted u post here to let you guys know. \n\nThey want to know what reddit thinks was probably on her mind and how bad of a fuck up is this?\n\nTldr: really hot business woman saw an elevator yank my shorts down, leading me to be fully exposed while I dropped Starbucks everywhere.,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/v5kt9v/tifu_by_not_wearing_underwear_to_pickup_starbucks/,False"

"tifu,millet_blue,TIFU by throwing up twice on the same date,I'm mortified...\nI simply cannot believe I did something so utterly stupid twice in a row :(\nI'm giving every detail, this post is going to be long. \n\nHere goes:\nI started my day by going to work, I got there at around 8:30 AM, I had to work a double that day because someone needed their morning shift covered. My first mistake was taking that morning shift. Fast forward to 5:30 PM, I went on my 30 minute break after working a solid nine hours and all I brought to eat was a small Ziploc bag containing 5 graham crackers, that was mistake number 2. This guy I'm dating, I'll call I'm Issac (because that's his name), texted me asking if I wanted to go out. I explained I was at work and wouldn't get off until 8:30, he told me to come hang out at 9:00. He said that him and all of his friends were going to our local carnival and I should meet them after I get off work. My 3rd mistake was telling him I'd be there. I finally got off work and drove about 30 minutes to the carnival, at this point I was exhausted but I was determined to see Issac and meet some of his friends I hadn't met. I caught up to him and the first thing we do is go on a very nauseating spinning ride, mistake number 4. I'll mention that I get motion sickness extremely easily, which I told Issac multiple times. After the ride I immediately felt like I was going to puke and I told Issac that. A few minutes later I'm 100% sure I'm about to vomit, so I found a garbage can and threw up for the first time that night. Afterwards Issac's friends caught up with us and I met them all, I felt a little better after puking and so I decided to go on a different but equally vomit inducing ride. I'm an idiot, I know. But that was mistake number 5. We stood in line, it was a ride called The Zipper, if you know anything about this ride I think you know where this story is going. If you don't know what The Zipper is let me explain, two people sit in a small cage-like thing and when I say small I mean SMALL, you get in and it's almost like a ferris wheel with one major difference, you are constantly spinning forward, backwards, and upside down. Anyway, we got on the ride and immediately I know I'm going to puke again, cue the next five minutes of hell. The ride starts and I decided to tell Issac that I'm for sure going to throw up again, he starts laughing, I don't know if he was laughing at me or laughing out of fear. I turned my head to face away from Issac and threw up all down the side of the cage-thing that we were in. So now the right side of my body and this ride are just covered in all of the water and graham crackers that I had consumed that day. I continued to throw up, meanwhile both of us were laughing and Issac was asking me over and over if I was okay. Finally, after minutes of torture, the ride ends. We got out. His friends got out after and Issac told them all about what happened. The most embarrassing part was sitting and watching the ride workers hose down the vomit. \nClearly I made a great first impression on Issac's friends, I'm really not sure if I'll be able to recover any kind of relationship with Issac. Although, he did say he'd go out with me again, I'm assuming it would be a pity date, he is probably thinking to himself \"I'll go on 1 more date with vomit girl, because I feel bad, then I won't ever have to see her again.\"\nUgh, I'm dead inside. \n\nTL;DR - I puked my guts out in front of my date and then proceeded to go on another ride and throw up again while sitting in a small enclosed ride with him.,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/v5kv3b/tifu_by_throwing_up_twice_on_the_same_date/,False"
"TwoXChromosomes,soverylucky,I've seen my husband cry three times in my life. Two of those times were when I was grieving, and the third was on our wedding day. I'm constantly amazed I was so lucky as to end up with someone who loves me so completely.,There are a lot of posts on this sub where women are venting or asking advice about the men in their lives who aren't supportive, or are even abusive.  I've been thinking about those women a lot recently, because I've been going through a really tough time lately and have been reminded how fortunate I am to have found my husband.  Marriage can effect your life in such contrasting ways.  The wrong partner can make your life a living hell, but the right partner becomes such a blessing. \n\nI'd only been dating my (now) husband for a little less than a year when one my sister died.  They'd never met, but during that week I saw my husband cry whenever I was overcome with grief.  Recently my father passed away, and we went through the same experience.  He'd just hold me and cry with me, even though I wouldn't say the two of them were especially close.  It just hurts him so much to see me hurt.  I had to be the 'strong one' for my mother and family, but when the doors closed and we were alone, he let me collapse and break down without judgement. \n\nI always had trust and self-esteem issues, and didn't even start dating until my late 20s because I didn't think I could ever find anyone I could trust to actually love me enough to be with me through thick and thin.  I didn't think that people could actually be empathetic on so many levels.  I'm so unbelievably grateful to learn I was wrong.,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/v5kv3c/ive_seen_my_husband_cry_three_times_in_my_life/,False"

"nosleep,Odd_directions,There will be a nuclear war in 2025. May God have mercy on us all.,Back in 1995, while working as a bartender at a popular tourist spot in Waikiki, something strange happened over the course of three months that made me uneasy for a long time. It all began one morning on my commute to work from Kailua, where I lived before I found a place in Honolulu. I was listening to The Morning Commute on the radio, which played music and talked about the news, when the show glitches out for a second. I thought it was my car radio acting up, but then the show changed. It was still The Morning Commute, but the host wasn\u2019t the same anymore. Before I had any time to listen to what he was saying, the static came back, and the old host returned.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was confused about this but forgot about it rather quickly. A few days later it happened again. This time, I paid closer attention to what the other host was saying, and I managed to catch a few words. He talked about a protest outside a new observatory on one of the islands. When I asked around about it at the bar no one knew what I was talking about. There wasn\u2019t even supposed to be an observatory at that location. This continued to happen on and off for a few days, and the other host always talked about news that didn\u2019t align with what was actually happening. My closest friend at the time didn\u2019t believe me when I told her about it, and after convincing her I wasn\u2019t joking, she suggested that I record the strange broadcast so that I could prove what I was saying.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI accepted the challenge and set up my tape recorder in my car, and the next time it happened I managed to get a short clip of the other host\u2019s voice before the signal cut out again. I played the recording for my friend, and she was just as baffled as I was. Before this stopped happening, I recorded several cassette tapes worth of the other host\u2019s voice. After a while, it became easier to follow what he and his guests were talking about, and it all came to a horrifying end after which this stopped happening for good. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlthough we were both troubled by what we heard, we assumed it must have been a hoax\u2013\u2013a very elaborate one, considering the different voices and the subjects discussed\u2013\u2013but we could never quite figure out how someone would go about faking something like this. The recordings ended up at my friend\u2019s place, and after she tragically passed away after an illness, I lost track of them. Ever since around 2005, things in the news have occasionally reminded me of what we heard on that strange broadcast from the mid-\u201990s, but without the tapes, I\u2019ve never been able to confirm anything.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA few days ago, though, when I was going through some old boxes in my parent\u2019s attic, I came across a box labelled \"Kailua tapes.\" As soon as I saw the label, I thought I had finally found the tapes. They weren\u2019t there, though. All I found were printed transcriptions of their contents. They had belonged to my friend, who had typed it all out for an article she was working on before she got sick. I don\u2019t know how they ended up in my parent\u2019s attic, but it\u2019s possible they put them there together with some of my other things during the year I was mourning my friend. I wasn\u2019t all there during that period, and a lot of things happened that are difficult to remember properly today. I took the box home and went through the pages one by one, and I was immediately transported back to 1995. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was shocked by how accurate everything was. The other host talked about things that are happening in the world today, things that no one could have known about in 1995. Below, I\u2019ve typed out the transcriptions of all the tapes. I\u2019m not sure what to make of all this, but I thought I\u2019d share it in case anyone else has any ideas.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\[Transcript of Tape 1.

First up, we\u2019ve got a report from our correspondent on the scene of a protest that\u2019s been going on for weeks now.\n\n\\[There is a sound of static for several seconds, then the audio becomes clearer.\\]\n\n**Correspondent:** Thanks, John. I\u2019m here at the site of a new astronomical observatory that\u2019s been under construction for a very long time now. The project has been controversial from the start, with many people concerned about the impact it will have on the environment. The protesters here say that the government is putting the interests of science ahead of the people.\n\n**Host:** What\u2019s the latest on the situation, Mindy?\n\n**Correspondent:** Well\u2013\u2013\n\n\\[The broadcast is interrupted by static.\\]\n\n**Original host:** \u2026has been found not guilty of double murder in the deaths of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman. This is a stunning verdict, and many people are surprised by the outcome. Simpson was facing up to life in prison if convicted, but he will now go free. This case has been one of the most high-profile and divisive in America, and it\u2019s sure to continue to be a source of debate for years to come\u2013\u2013\n\n\\[End of Tape 1\\]\n\n\\[Transcript of Tape 2. The audio is relatively clear but worsens over time.\\]\n\n**Host:** \u2026ning Hawaii! You\u2019re listening to The Morning Commute, and this is\u2013\u2013as always\u2013\u2013your host John Fitzgerald. We\u2019ve got plenty of news and gossip for you today, but first, let\u2019s check out the traffic report. Over to you Rick.\n\n**Reporter:** Thanks, John. H-1 is moving smoothly this morning, no accidents to report. However, there is construction on the Pali Highway, so expect delays in that area. There\u2019s also construction on the H-3, but it\u2019s not causing any delays. You can expect construction on the H-2 to cause delays in both directions, so if you\u2019re taking the H-2 this morning, be sure to give yourself some extra time. As always, please drive carefully!\n\n**Host:** Thank you for that concise summation, Rick. In the news today, a new study shows that more people are moving to the suburbs than the city. The study shows that the number of people moving to the suburbs has increased by 5% in the past year. The number of people moving to the city has decreased by 2%. The study also shows that the number of people moving to the suburbs is increasing faster than the number of people moving to the city. This trend is expected to continue for the foreseeable future, and is in line with a similar, worldwide trend.\n\nSome researchers have even gone so far as to call it a form of de-urbanization, a phenomenon commonly attributed to the pandemic of 2020 when people first started working from home in large numbers. Maybe it\u2019s time to rename this show to The Morning Commute \u2013 From the Bedroom to the Living Room! \n\nIn other news, there's a new trend taking over Oahu that's sure to get you snoring. It's called \"snoorbing\"! Apparently, the idea is to snore as loudly as possible in public places like the beach, park, or even in line at the grocery store. Some people are even using special devices to amplify their snores. It all started on social media, of course, and there's even a hashtag for it. Some people have voiced concerns that snoorbing could be disruptive, but most people seem to be finding it amusing. So, if you're looking for a new way to annoy strangers, give snoorbing a try! So far, the trend seems to be mostly confined to young people, but who knows? Maybe we'll all be snoorbing soon! I think I'll pass, though. My wife already tells me no one snores louder than I do! Now, let\u2019s listen to the new single \u201cFalling Star\u201d by The Pineapple Junkies. The Pineapple Junkies are a local band here in Oahu, and this is their latest single. It\u2019s a catchy tune with a great message. So, turn it up and enjoy!\n\n\\[Song plays until it fades into static.\\]\n\n\\[End of Tape 2\\]\n\n\\[Transcript of Tape 3.

There\u2019s a light breeze blowing, but nothing too crazy. Perfect weather to spend the day at the beach! Today, I\u2019m joined by Ryan Harris, the author of the new novel Red Skies Over Yoshiwara. First off, congratulations on your new book! Can you tell us a little bit about it?\n\n**Guest:** Thank you! Red Skies Over Yoshiwara is a historical fiction novel set in Japan during the Edo period. It tells the story of a young woman named Kikuko who is sold into the red-light district of Yoshiwara and the challenges she faces in trying to survive and escape her circumstances.\n\n**Host:** Wow, that sounds like a really interesting and intense story. What inspired you to write it?\n\n**Guest:** I\u2019ve always been interested in Japanese history and culture, and I wanted to write a novel that would transport readers to another time and place. I also wanted to shine a light on the often-hidden history of Japanese women, who were often sold into prostitution or forced into arranged marriages.\n\n**Host:** That\u2019s definitely something that isn\u2019t talked about enough. What do you hope readers will take away from your book?\n\n**Guest:** I hope that readers will be transported to another time and place, and that they\u2019ll come to understand the strength and resilience of the human spirit. Kikuko is an incredibly brave and determined young woman, and I hope her story will inspire others.\n\n\\[Static for one minute.\\]\n\n**Commercial:** \u2026know his name... You can\u2019t say it three times without him appearing. Beetlejuice is back in Beetlejuice 2, and this time he\u2019s bringing the laughs, the scares, and the ectoplasm.

In his inauguration speech, he took shots at his predecessor, Joe Biden, for not doing enough to stop Russia from invading Ukraine and for failing to create more jobs. Trump also boasted about how he took back the presidency after Biden allegedly stole it from him. Following these statements, Trump went into some of the actions he plans to take during his second term in office. The most controversial of these is his plan to arm schoolteachers in order to prevent mass shootings, an issue that\u2019s been at the forefront of the national conversation in recent years.\n\n\\[Static for ten seconds.\\]\n\n**Unknown Correspondent/Reporter:** \u2026uguration Day was marked by a series of protests across the country, with demonstrators marching in opposition to President Trump\u2019s policies on a range of issues including immigration, women\u2019s rights, and the environment. There were also a number of reports of violence and property damage, although the vast majority of protests were peaceful. In Washington, D.C., police used pepper spray and stun grenades to disperse a small group of protesters who were throwing rocks and bottles. There were also reports of fires being set and windows being broken. In New York City, protesters marched through the streets, chanting slogans such as \"No Trump, no KKK, no fascist USA.\" In Los Angeles, demonstrators marched to City Hall, where they held a rally.

This comes as tensions between the two countries continue to rise, with Russia recently announcing plans to deploy nuclear-capable missiles to its westernmost territory in response to NATO\u2019s expansion eastward. The START treaty, which was first signed in 1991, requires both the United States and Russia to limit their nuclear arsenals and bans the development of new nuclear weapons. It\u2019s seen as a key part of maintaining global stability, and its collapse could have dangerous consequences.

Carl Vinson carrier strike group is moving towards Pearl Harbor in response to China\u2019s recent activities in the Taiwan Strait. The Carl Vinson is the flagship of the Carrier Strike Group 1, and it includes the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson, the guided-missile cruisers USS Lake Champlain and USS Philippine Sea, and the guided-missile destroyers USS Michael Murphy and USS Wayne E. Meyer. With us today we have professor of political science and former director of the Chinese Studies program at Georgetown University, Dr. Elizabeth Rodriguez.\n\n**Host:** Dr. Rodriguez, thanks so much for being with us.\n\n**Guest:** Thanks, John.\n\n**Host:** So, China has been moving troops and equipment to the Taiwan Strait in what some are calling the largest mobilization of forces in the area in years. How do you interpret these actions by Beijing?\n\n**Guest:** Well, I think there are a couple of things going on here. First, I think Beijing is trying to send a signal to both Taiwan and the United States that it is serious about reunifying Taiwan with the mainland. This is something that China has been talking about for many, many years, but I think they feel that under President Trump, who has been much more supportive of Taiwan than any previous U.S. president, they need to make a stronger push in this direction. Second, I think Beijing is also trying to take advantage of the fact that the United States is in a bit of a transitional period right now. We have a new administration that is still trying to get its bearings and put together a coherent China policy. And I think Beijing is trying to take advantage of that to push forward on some of its key priorities.\n\n**Host:** Do you think the situation in Europe, with Russia behaving in a similar fashion toward Poland and Finland right now, has something to do with China feeling emboldened and taking this opportunity to kind of make its move on Taiwan?\n\n**Guest:** I think that\u2019s definitely a factor. I think Beijing is watching very closely what\u2019s happening in Eastern Europe, particularly with regard to the buildup of Russian troops along the border with Poland and Finland. And I think they see that as an opportunity to try to take advantage of a distracted United States. So, I think the situation in Europe is definitely a factor here. But I also think that we need to remember that this is something that China has been wanting to do for a very long time. They\u2019ve been gradually building up their military capabilities in the region. They now have a much more modern military than they did even ten years ago. And I think they feel that they\u2019re in a position to finally make a move on Taiwan.\n\n**Host:** What do you think are the implications of these actions by China for the United States?\n\n**Guest:** Well, I think there are a couple of implications. First, I think it\u2019s a very clear signal that the U.S.-China rivalry is here to stay, and that it\u2019s going to be a very intense rivalry. I think we are going to see more and more confrontations between the United States and China, not just in the Taiwan Strait, but also in the South China Sea, in the East China Sea, and really all around the world.\n\n\\[Static for ten seconds.\\]\n\n**Host:** How do you think China will react to the arrival of the aircraft carrier group to the region?\n\n**Guest:** I think Beijing will definitely be watching the arrival of the US aircraft carrier group very closely.

Last night, a Chinese vessel reportedly fired upon a Taiwanese fishing boat, killing one fisherman and injuring three others. The incident took place in the disputed waters between Taiwan and China. Taiwan\u2019s government has condemned the attack and has demanded an apology from China. China has not yet responded to the incident. It\u2019s unclear what provoked the attack, but it comes at a time of increased tensions between China and Taiwan.\n\nWe\u2019ll be following this story throughout the day and we\u2019ll have more on it later in the show.

He\u2019s just a bigoted, sexist, racist person and I can\u2019t believe that the university would allow him to speak there.\n\n**Host:** Well, it sounds like you don\u2019t agree with his beliefs. I can\u2019t say I do, either. But don\u2019t you think that everyone has a right to free speech?\n\n**Caller:** Free speech doesn\u2019t mean that you can just say whatever you want without consequence. Peterson is a dangerous person, and I don\u2019t think he should be given a platform to spew his hatred.\n\n**Host:** I understand where you\u2019re coming from, but I think we need to be careful about censorship. If we start censoring people because we don\u2019t agree with them, then we\u2019re no better than them.\n\n**Caller:** I\u2019m not saying we should censor him, I\u2019m just saying we shouldn\u2019t give him a platform. He doesn\u2019t deserve one.\n\n**Host:** What would you say to Peterson if you had the chance?\n\n**Caller:** I would tell him that he\u2019s a sexist, racist, bigoted person and that he doesn\u2019t deserve a platform! It just feels like we\u2019re moving in the wrong direction, you know. It\u2019s 2025 for crying out loud! We\u2019ve had enough of old white men spreading their alt-right ideology!

You\u2019re listening to The Morning Commute, and we have some breaking news to share with you. A large explosion has been observed just south of the island of Taiwan. What we know so far is that earlier this morning, USS Lake Champlain, a guided-missile cruiser, was sailing in the area on a routine exercise when it detected what appeared to be a Chinese missile launch. The missile was tracked and intercepted by two SM-3 missiles fired from the ship.\n\n\\[A few seconds of static.\\]\n\n**Host:** ...okay, so unfortunately, it appears that the explosion was caused by the interceptor missiles detonating too close to the launch \\[Inaudible\\], resulting in significant damage to the Chinese vessel. We\u2019re still waiting for more information, but it seems like this could escalate into a serious situation. We\u2019ll keep you updated as we learn more. In the meantime, I\u2019ve gotten in touch with Dr. Kamea Alapai, a local expert on Chinese military affairs, and he\u2019s going to join us on the show over phone to help us understand what\u2019s going on. Welcome to the show, Kamea.\n\n**Guest:** Thank you for having me.\n\n**Host:** So Kamea, can you tell us what you know about this incident?\n\n**Guest:** Well, I don\u2019t think anyone knows more than what\u2019s been reported on the news so far, but if I would have to guess, I would say the damage to the Chinese vessel was unintended. I don\u2019t think the US was trying to start a conflict, but accidents happen, and this could be a very serious one.\n\n**Host:** But they fired first, didn\u2019t they? They fired the missiles.\n\n**Guest:** Yes, although I would caution that we don\u2019t have the full picture of what transpired before the missiles were fired. But I think it\u2019s possible that the US was acting in self-defense.\n\n**Host:** But why would the Chinese fire a missile in the first place?\n\n**Guest:** I don\u2019t know. Maybe they were trying to send a message to the US. It might have been a warning shot. This is all speculation, of course, and again, I think it\u2019s important to remember that we don\u2019t have all the information yet.\n\n**Host:** Kamea, thank you for joining us. We\u2019ll be sure to have you back on the show as we learn more.\n\n**Guest:** Thank you, John.\n\n**Host:** I\u2019m getting some worrying reports now about a tweet supposedly showing, either the initial explosion or another one.

I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s going on, but it looks like this incident in the Taiwan Strait just got a lot more serious. If this footage is real, and I have no reason to doubt it, then we could be looking at a major disaster. I\u2019m no expert, please keep that in mind listeners, but that looked a lot like a tactical nuke. It\u2019s trending on Twitter, and yet there\u2019s still no official word from the US government.

With us now, for the second time today, is Dr. Kamea Alapai, a local expert on Chinese military affairs. Kamea, can you tell us what you know about the US counterattack?\n\n**Guest:** I would say the US is retaliating with overwhelming force. The situation is out of control at this point.\n\n**Host:** What do you think will happen next?\n\n**Guest:** I don\u2019t know. This is a grave situation. I think we could be looking at a full-scale war. It\u2019s hard to say, but I think anything is possible at this point.\n\n**Host:** I see. And what does this mean for our island, or for Hawaii in general?\n\n**Guest:** Well, if a war does break out, I think it\u2019s safe to say that Hawaii will be caught in the middle. We could be looking at a lot of damage, or even worse.

"DIY,blubeard34,Installing garage-to-home door for basement rental unit,I rent out my basement and need to replace the hollow core interior door separating the main floor and basement to help with noise and security. I decided to go for a pre-hung garage to home door since it is solid core, seals and is designed for a deadbolt.\n\nThe problem is that this door rests on the attached threshold which is not intended to be put on finished floor, especially not floating LVP like I have in the doorway. I want to keep the LVP, so removing it is not an option. \n\nI'm trying to decide between two options:\n\n1. Remove the threshold so it looks more like an interior doorway and seal the bottom against noise using an automatic seal.  To keep the jambs from resting on the floor I'd have to shim the jamb slightly off the floor and tack it into place or undercut it afterwards to have a gap. My question is whether a door like this can have the jambs suspended off the floor or if that is going to cause issues?\n2. Keep the threshold and have the door rest on the LVP. This wouldn't look as nice, but would probably provide a better seal against noise and would prevent anyone from tampering with the automatic door seal. But I'm pretty sure it's not okay to have a door like this sitting on an LVP floating floor, right? But it seems like heavier objects like refrigerators, ranges and large dressers are usually placed right on LVP so I'm confused.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3sh2snkivu391.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=aa2322114d8aef10d8bb6145535bf268f297cb28\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o567bkkivu391.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=920cdbad27607f1e58ea0f893179184826594c0c\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cj6uugkivu391.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=94499df903f9ad47fb2a2262d2c0ccf0ccacd57d,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/v5kvns/installing_garagetohome_door_for_basement_rental/,False"

"TwoXChromosomes,dandelion_dobby,Did I overreact to date being over 20 mins late to second date?,So - we (29F, 30M) had a very nice first date together (he was actually 30 mins early to this one haha...) which lasted two hours or so before he had to run to get an overnight train.\n\nHe was out of the city for a few days. He'd already asked me if I'd be keen to meet again on the first date and I said I was, texted him to see when he'd be free for a second meet, we met up 7 days later.\n\nI was truly quite excited to see him again as I thought we had a lot of shared interests and good chemistry. We were meant to meet at 8 as he was meeting a work friend for dinner beforehand, he asked if we could shift it to 8.30pm instead. OK fine.\n\nGet to the venue, 8.30pm. 8.40 comes and goes and I've still not heard from him so drop a text asking if he'll be here soon. 8.45pm he finally replies and says '5 mins, just coming'.\n\nIn total he was 20 mins late... I ordinarily wouldn't care if he had texted beforehand but I spent 15 mins standing outside this bar alone worried I'd been stood up. We live in a very small town, it's not hard to get around, and he was meeting the friend for dinner literally on the adjacent street (it would take me 2 mins to walk from the one venue to the other).\n\nWhen he arrived I worry I made it a bit awkward - I asked if he was still keen to go out given how late it now was (on a weeknight), and said I wouldn't ordinarily care that he was late but I found it strange he didn't give me a heads up. He said dinner with his colleague went on and on and they were in a conversation he found hard to get out of.\n\nSo - was I being crazy and unreasonable by asking if he still wanted to go on the date and questioning his interest in heading out? We did end up going out and had a nice time. We ended up going for drinks at the venue he just came from. I'm just not sure if my behaviour there was normal or offputting.\n\ntl;dr date was 20 mins late to our second date because he was busy having dinner with a colleague on the street right beside where we were meeting, 2 mins away. he didn't give me a heads up he'd be late until 8.45 after i texted him (we were due to meet 8.30),https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/v5kvto/did_i_overreact_to_date_being_over_20_mins_late/,False"

"tifu,Cheap-Suspect2644,TIFU by not living up to the hype,My wife put on some weight, she's around 170 pounds. It's not COVID-19 weight, just age weight gain. It's wonderful, she's very curvey and she still has the flat stomach. Perfect. Two weeks ago she recently started going to the gym and seeing her in clothes is AMAZING. I haven't been able to keep my hands off of her in passing, kissing her, or pressing myself on her when she gives me the opportunity which is always.\n\nWe have no kids and we are ten years apart, her being younger.\n\nNow, there are two things I do on the weekend, spend time with my wife and play the game. We have shared activities but man I do love my game. I still have the game because we know its important to have separate activities. It's true we have argued about the game and sometimes it takes priority over her and that's when I know to chill out so I leave it alone for a few weeks and then go back to it again. I always try to be aware of her needs and I ask her how she is feeling and if she needs me to do anything.\n\nFast forward to today (the fuck up). My wife says to me \"I'm going to rest for a bit (she played her game as well), take a shower and then we can have sex.\" She's straight to the point. I love it and it doesnt leave me confused on what she wants. I'm playing the game and I've mastered the art of responding with attention, I say \"Okay. That sounds like a plan.\" While she's playing the game we talk about what positions she wants it in and I agree, I KNOW its going to be a great time. I know enough about my wife to know that from her dirty talk, she wants to be dominated in bed. Those are her words, not mine. We continue to talk to each other while she's playing the game and the topics vary. Eventually she gets up, showers and I get up a few minutes later to do the same.\n\nBy the time I get out of the shower my wife has her hair up, she smells amazing, she has my favorite lotion and fragrance on and she lays in the bed. She put in all this effort for me. I enter our bedroom and my wife is laying on the bed on her stomach. She's perfect. I give her compliments, I even take a photo of her to remeber the moment and to show her how working out is helping her body (she doesn't like working out) I caress her body, all the while I'm putting on my gaming pants. \n\nYep I did just that. I caressed my wife while she laid in bed looking amazing, ready for me to put in work  and back up the shit I was talking earlier. I finally had my gaming pants on, walked away and played the game. I didnt see her face when I walked away but she continued to talk to me while she laid there naked waiting on me and I was playing the game. She laid in the bed for 15 minutes. She eventually got dressed and I realized what happened 30 minutes later. I found her downstairs and I approached her with my shirt off (it's her thing) but she just asked for some space and now she's not talking to me.\n\nI'm a fucking idiot.\n\nTldr; wife told me ahead of time that she wanted to have sex and laid out the plans for doing so. I've been making her horny all week and when she was ready get down, I put on my gaming pants and played the game. I realized my mistake too late, now she won't talk to me.,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/v5kx6r/tifu_by_not_living_up_to_the_hype/,False"

"nosleep,Spectral42,My dad is not who he says he is. I broke into his office and found his secrets., Hi! I guess? This is my first time posting, and I am not used to sharing things with people. Especially on the internet: I can't tell my mom what I saw or what I stole from my dad's office. My name is Carly; recently, I broke into my dad's office on a whim and discovered his secrets. It is Tuesday right now, but I will take you through the events as they happened last week.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Thursday**\n\nMy father had just come home from work after a rough day. After I got home from school, my mother told me to leave him alone, and that's not something that usually happens. I have never seen my mother this tense. She looked tired. My mother didn't do her hair and didn't wear makeup.\n\nMy mother and I never leave the house without having our hair done and makeup on. She looked so sad. \"Honey, make sure to leave your father alone today. We will be eating out, and I will bring your food to your room.\" She told me when we entered the house. I wanted to ask why but something about her tone made me keep my mouth shut. The last thing I wanted to do was upset my mom.\n\nWhen I went upstairs, I closed my door and went about my business. The whole day I felt uneasy; I wasn't grounded, so why had I been confined to my room? I tried to keep myself distracted with tv. It wasn't until I heard the front door open and slam shut that I knew my dad had gotten home.\n\nThere was no yelling, no other sound; the house was eerie. Again, I tried to keep myself distracted by watching cartoons. When my mother knocked at my door, I opened it and took the bag she offered me. She looked so tired, but there was something else there. I thought it was fear. \"Thank you,\" I told her. I offered to put on a movie for us, but she told me she had other things to do that night. She apologized to me three times.\n\nWhen I closed the door, I paused because I could feel the hair on the back of my neck standing on end. I ran my hand over my arms when I felt goosebumps. I couldn't figure out why. Later, I would realize I was scared of my mother, or I was scared for my mother. I didn't sleep right that night because of how quiet the house was. Most people probably would love the silence, but it made me uneasy all night. It wasn't until the sun came up that I finally felt comfortable enough to sleep.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Friday**\n\nFriday is when everything came crashing down around me. It started at breakfast when I came downstairs in the morning. My mother was sitting on the couch watching a blank tv. \"Good morning, mom,\" I said as I approached the couch. She didn't turn around, \"Breakfast is in the kitchen. Your father is in his office. Don't bother him, sweetheart. When you're done eating, go back to your room.\"\n\nI was not expecting to be sent to my room again. Again I wanted to protest, but her tone made me hesitate. I went to the kitchen to grab snacks and water and have some breakfast. I was too nervous to eat. I could hear someone speaking in the basement from where I was standing in the kitchen.\n\nI turned my head to listen closer. There was someone else speaking in the basement. I didn't recognize the other voice, and my father wasn't speaking. \"Honey. Don't eavesdrop on your father's work. Head upstairs. Now.\" Her tone was different; she sounded mad. \"Did I do something wrong?\" I asked her, my voice cracked. I was ready to cry for no other reason other than being nervous. Why was I so scared?\n\n\"This is not up for debate. Go to your room.\" She said without turning around. I did not argue with her. I sped, walked to the stairs, and went to my room. I closed the door as softly as possible. Something was wrong. It wasn't until I grabbed my phone that I noticed the time. It was 10:00 AM. I didn't have school today, my last day was Thursday, but it was weird that my mother let me sleep in late.\n\nAbout an hour later, there was a knock on my door, \"Honey? Your mother and I are heading out.\" I heard my father speak. I slowly got up and opened the door; I didn't know what I was expecting. My father looked normal, except that his hair color was different. He usually had blonde hair, but now it was dirtier looking. \"Okay. When will you be back?\" I asked. \"Tonight.\" He said as he handed me two twenty-dollar bills. \"This is for dinner. Please stay inside and, as always, stay out of my office.\" My father told me before he turned to walk away.\n\nEverything my parents were doing was making me extremely uneasy. I watched from my bedroom as the car left and that's when I got to work. My mother was not acting normally; my father didn't seem tense. Something was not adding up. I slowly left my room and made my way to my parent's bedroom. The bed was still unmade, and the room was a mess. As I walked around the room, I began to hear ringing. It sounded like a cellphone. I searched the room as much as possible without moving too many items around. I could not find the cellphone.\n\nAs the ringing continued, I exited the room and went downstairs as fast as possible. The ringing was coming from the basement; it was coming from my father's office. I assumed this meant he had a second phone. I never go down to his office. It has been banned for as long as I can remember. As I reached for the handle, I stopped and slid my shirt sleeve down. After my hand was covered, I gave the doorknob a jiggle. It was locked. I don't know what my father does for work, or I didn't. But I knew how to open it.\n\nI went to the kitchen to grab a knife and did my best to spin the lock. If my father wanted this hidden so bad, he should have gotten a better lock because this was surprisingly easy to open. As I opened the door, my heart began to skip beats. I could feel it. I was so scared, but the ringing didn't stop, so neither did I. I slowly worked my way down the steps.\n\nWhen I reached the floor, I scanned the basement. It was my first time down here, so I wanted to see as much as possible. My father's desk had three monitors on it and two different laptops. I ran to the desk to see if he had left anything on; all of the devices were off but open.\n\nAfter scanning the desk, I moved to check on the ringing. It was coming from an older-looking cellphone. It still had a touch screen. The caller was labeled as MIKE SYMBONIE. I did not answer the phone.\n\nI turned to inspect some of the file cabinets. As I slowly pulled out files, I was able to read the tops of each.\n\nFile: FCG\n\nFile: UGOUP\n\nFile: WPAFSA\n\nThere were hundreds of other files with tons of labels I didn't recognize. That is when I heard a car pulling into the driveway. I almost knocked the drawer from the file cabinet. As fast as I could, I ran upstairs, I did make sure the door was locked, and the lights were off. I ran up to my room to see who was in the driveway. It wasn't often that my parents came home early.\n\nThere was a black car I didn't recognize outside. I heard the front door open, and my body went tense. I went right for my cell phone and was shocked to see I didn't have service. I tossed the phone onto the bed and went to hide in my closet. I could hear boots downstairs. My hands were shaking. My knees felt weak, and I started crying. The tears ran down my face, and I tried to hold my breath as much as possible.\n\n\ufeffI stayed in the closet until I heard the car drive away. When my parents came home, they didn't announce themselves; no one came upstairs to see me. Nothing felt right.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Saturday**\n\nMy father was angry on Saturday, so I stayed clear of his path. My mother stayed in her room all day. I dug through my room for most of my day, looking for an old cellphone and laptop. I tend to keep old electronics just in case my new ones break. As I went through my closet, I found an old phone and laptop my grandmother got me, but I never opened it. I was looking for something like this because my phone randomly lost connection.\n\nI was uneasy and having a hard time trusting my parents. I spent all day in my room working with my new electronics. That night my house was quiet again, and I ran out of snacks. I knew in the morning I would have to go downstairs.\n\n \n\n**Sunday**\n\nMy mother looked better on Sunday, but my father was acting worse. The way he was looking at me made me incredibly nervous. My mother tried to tell me it was because he worked too hard. She tried to convince me everything was fine. I didn't believe her, and I didn't want to stay downstairs.\n\nWhen I went to bed that night, I heard my door open; I could hear the door creak open. I couldn't see who it was, but I saw the eyes reflecting off of my bedroom window. I stayed up until five in the morning and slept through the whole day.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Monday**\n\nYesterday was an important day for me; my parents went out, which meant I was free to explore. When they left, the first thing I did was restock my snacks and drinks. I had a suspicion I wanted to investigate, so I left my bedroom door open and went back to the basement.\n\nAs I got down, I moved my sleeves down to tap one of my father's laptops. When the screen lit up, I was greeted with a password request. I tried everything before landing on my mother's birthday. I can't believe it worked; it was almost too easy.\n\nAs the laptop booted up, I checked his desk. I found multiple posted notes and took pictures with my second phone. Once the computer was fully booted, I watched as a couple of files popped up on the screen. I battled with this for a second but clicked on the file.\n\nAs the video started, I saw a young man sitting in front of a camera. As the video played, he talked about a creature that had been targeting him and his family. He described the creature as tall as a man with four arms and jagged teeth. Unfortunately, I didn't get to see the rest of the video before I heard a car pull into our driveway. I quickly closed the video and ran upstairs. I made sure to turn the lights off and lock the door.\n\nOnce I got into my room, I shut my door and hid in my closet. I could hear the boots again, but they were coming up my stairs this time. I began shaking again. I was not expecting the boots to arrive at my bedroom door. I could hear whatever was out there breathing. I thought I would piss my pants when I heard my bedroom door open. Once again, I could feel tears streaming down my face.\n\nIt took the boots a long time to go away, and the whole time I was as still as stone. I didn't dare try and see whoever it was. But when the thing was gone, I made sure the car was gone from the driveway. When my parents came back, I didn't bother to go downstairs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Today**\n\nI am coming to you from the public library. I haven't been sleeping well, and I have been having bad nightmares. My parents are acting as normal as they were last week, but I still don't trust them. Every time I go near my father, the hair on my arms stands up, and I get uneasy.\n\nI don't think my dad is who he says he is, and I still don't understand what he does for work. But I know my mother is acting normal again, and my father is dying his hair! I found the dye in the bathroom this morning. I can't explain it, but I am scared in my own house. I am scared of my father, and I am afraid of whatever he has been doing in the basement.,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/v5kz6l/my_dad_is_not_who_he_says_he_is_i_broke_into_his/,False"

"gaming,mean_emcee,Which console platform would be the better alternative for indie gaming on a budget?, \n\nHey  All. Lately I've come to accept that I don't really have the means to  access the games on my Steam account without running into technical  problems for my current computers. While I did put myself down for a  Steam Deck reservation initially, I'm beginning to have doubts if it  will be able to arrive with the supply chain being as fickle as it is.  Along with this, I have recently heard that there have been some  technical problems and a lot of tweaking to get a majority of games to  run smoothly on it. I would consider a gaming laptop as an alternative,  but I don't really have a strong budget for a full fledged gaming  computer, and have laptops that are more geared towards digital art  rather than gaming.\n\nWhile I'm  content with most games that I have and can wait on some titles for  later, I have been thinking on where to repurchase some games I really  want to experience. As it stands I have a large mix of First and Third  Party games on PS4, as well as a sizable chunk of digital indies.  However, I feel mixed on how supportive Sony tends to be towards indie  developers.  While I do enjoy the Switch, I am also skeptical on the  longevity of digital titles and if they'll carry over to next gen or  not, as well as how smoothly indies would be able to run on it.\n\nWith  that said, I need to be very conscious on how I experience indies  moving foward, especially with my budget getting tighter. Should I stick  with what systems I have and choose between the Switch or PS4? Which  would have the greater longevity for quality indie games in your mind?  Or should I hold out hope for the Deck and put in the investment for a  greater quantity of mixed titles? Thoughts and input would be greatly  appreciated.,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/v5l48w/which_console_platform_would_be_the_better/,False"

"movies,TruFals,Would you watch an Outsiders (1983) Reunion?,Concept: reunite the actors who played the original Outsiders\n\nCast: Emilio Estevez, Matt Dillon, Ralph Macchio, C. Thomas Howell, Tom Cruise, Rob Lowe\n\nNote: obviously, a cast member is missing being deceased (Patrick Swayze, r.i.p)\n\nApproach: could be one of a few. A pseudo-sequel, a soft reboot, a parody... the show doesn't even have to be called the Outsiders or feature a group called the Outsiders. All that matters is the actors. Six is probably pushing the limits but if four could be reunited for at least a quarter of the project, that's something I'd want to watch.\n\nFormat: doesn't have to be a theatrical release. Could be a mini-series. Maybe something in the style of Riding with Norman Reedus.\n\nWho I think would return: Ralph Macchio and Rob Lowe seem like they have a fond connection to their past as Outsiders. Emilio is a little iffy and I don't really know what's going on with Howell. Tom Cruise is such big shot, a lot of factors would have to come together before I believe he would participate. Similar to Howell, I'm not really sure what Matt Dillon is doing. He might be into it if this happened though. As mentioned before, a cast member is deceased, so I wouldn't expect a full cast reunion.,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/v5l594/would_you_watch_an_outsiders_1983_reunion/,False"

Is it something about his acting abilities? Is it a time-era thing where his career has literally spanned decades? Marketability or box office returns? His thoughts and ideas he brings in each movie he\u2019s involved with? \n\nAnd the other thing that I was wondering was, if Tom Cruise really is the \u201clast true movie star\u201d, if there\u2019s someone out there today that\u2019s just on the edge of being the next actor/actress to take that title?,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/v5l5i4/question_tom_cruise_and_the_the_last_great_movie/,False"

"DIY,madmax_br5,Help with tapered concrete \"shelves\" for water garden?,I'm converting a concrete fountain into a water garden which will house aquatic plants and a few fish. The existing fountain is an 11-foot diameter, 32-inch deep flat bottom cylinder. For a water garden, you want a terraced step down from the edge to the deepest part as different plants prefer different depths. I'm trying to choose a method of building these terraces that doesn't break the bank or my back. One viable path seems to be using standard concrete blocks to create stepped \"pillars\" 16\" on center that I can bridge with concrete pavers to create a few rings of shelving at different heights. The problem is, because each ring of the terrace has a different diameter, I would need to taper the edges of every paver so that they are the right width. At 24 pavers per ring and 4 rings, this would require tapering both edges of 96pavers, which is 192 tapers to cut or chisel. This seems like it would be a ton of dirty work. Curious if anyone has a better idea of how to create these terraces that would be less work?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tf1xdts70v391.png?width=1712&format=png&auto=webp&s=39d3e3d63e03a27e993cb3f889287b93bb7189d7,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/v5leoh/help_with_tapered_concrete_shelves_for_water/,False"

"TwoXChromosomes,sheshoots4stars,I had the most traumatic experience with a doctor,Hold on to your hats because this one gets worse and worse the further you read.\n\nI was recently diagnosed with an extremely painful abscess  in a very delicate place. After two trips to urgent care, three trips to the ER and a follow up with my primary care doctor, all within the span of two weeks, I finally got an appointment with a specialist. Everyone up to this point from the nurses to the doctors had been amazing, supportive, empathetic, and sweet. But this specialist was probably the worst interaction I've ever had with a medical professional.\n\nFor context, he's a significantly older man and I'm in my late twenties. The appointment started with him asking me questions and then immediately cutting me off, rolling his eyes, and basically telling my that I was wrong about the location even though it was visible with a mirror. I told him I had had a CT scan done in the ER which led to a long tirade about how stupid the ER doctors were since he believes CT scans are useless in these situations. He had already determined the status of it based on nothing but his own assumptions since he never even listened to my answers.\n\nNext was the exam, which required me to remove my pants and bend over this table that he raised up so that my hips were pointed in the air and I was basically suspended there. I removed the gauze so he could examine me, which he responded to by saying \"Bad girl! That's dirty!\" and slapped my hand. He was extremely rough and pulled at my currently open wound. He surprised me by jabbing my arm with this probe to demonstrate that it wasn't a needle and told me he was going to push it into the abscess. I started panicking because I was already in a lot of pain and was anticipating a lot more from this. I asked him to wait several times, with no success. I continued to tell him to wait, getting more and more forceful and frantic until he finally paused. I asked for two minutes to calm down and ready myself. He tried to shame me by saying \"You're really just wasting you own time. I have to do this to examine you. I guess you really don't want me to help you.\" After a few more seconds I told him to go ahead. Finally, he surprised me by pushing a finger inside of me without much warning.\n\nAfter the exam, he told me he couldn't do a proper exam because I was too tense but was still going with his earlier assumption that things had progressed to the point that I now needed a surgery. I was still crying, which only got worse as he proceeded to explain that the surgery would entail him slicing me open from inside to outside and letting it heal on its own without any type of stitches. When asked why I was still crying I told him I was worried about the surgery. He told me that I shouldn't be worried, because when I inevitably have children it will be 100x worse. He also told me I was silly when I asked about the possibility of contamination when going to the bathroom.\n\nThe whole experience was just a whole new trauma on top of weeks of excruciating pain with months more to come.\n\nThe silver lining, though, is that my husband has been absolutely amazing through all of this. He has driven me to every appointment and held my hand through every examination and treatment. He has basically waited on me hand and foot for the past few weeks and has just been so supportive.,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/v5lg03/i_had_the_most_traumatic_experience_with_a_doctor/,False"

"tifu,manar-jaafar,TIFU by confronting my best friend in the wrong way,Honestly it's last month not today\n\nMy problem is somehow childish, but i want to get this out of my chest..\n\nI (20f) and my best friends (20f twin) were hanging out last month, i previously had an an issue with one of them (will call her A), her behaviors with me were annoying me for a while, that's why when we met and saw i got kind of ignited.\nI didn't react well, confronted her early and i know how sensitive she is. I told her that i'm kinda annoyed with her and all what she answered whatever, you hate everyone, of course you will hate me eventually.\n\nThis made me even more mad, told her that even though i don't like people in general there is still  a huge difference between other people and my close circle who i really love and care about.\n\nAfter a while, she started avoiding me completely, the whole time it was just me and her sister and she will always walk ahead of us and when she want to say something she would whisper to her twin.\nIt got really uncomfortable and made worried because i know exactly how it feel to be neglected, me and her had the same issue, she was ignored all the time by her childhood friends who always preferred her sister, and i was always ignored by my cousins because they always preferred my sister.\n\nAfter getting home in a day or so i decided to write an apology message for her, explained how i regretted my actions, how i feel about everything, how i don't want the situation to take long and effect our friendship, and told her how i know it hurts her and i don't invalidate her feelings about it, she told me thank you for your apology, will think about it\n\n18 days later.. i'm on my nerves, don't know what to do and she's still avoiding me, messaged her, she gave a dry reply and started ignoring me again. Been almost a week.\n\nI don't know what to do.. should i just cut her off now? Should i keep trying with her? I don't have any other friends aside from these irl, i do avoid people especially that i'm the only international in my uni and they treat me badly while sugar coating their behavior.\n\n\nTL;DR: i confronted my friend early while we were hanging out, she started avoiding me, i decided to apologize a day after what happened, she thanked me for my apology and ignored me for 18 days, spoked to her again and she gave a dry reply and then she was back to ignoring me.,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/v5lmm9/tifu_by_confronting_my_best_friend_in_the_wrong/,False"
